We\nintroduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that\nreframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates\nover 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse\nantibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized\ndata splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local\nperturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel\nantigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an\nm-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal\naffinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold\ndifference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we\nintroduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein\nlanguage model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise\nbinding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current\nmethods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that\nranking-based training improves robustness and transferability.

To\naddress this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,\nfor enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.\nBy decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage\nprogressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that\nrespectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial\ncatalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in\nthe latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware\ndomain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of\ndownstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,\nenzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and\nenzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance\nevaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI\nconsistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized\nmethods across seven benchmarks.

We present a novel framework drawn from statistical\nphysics -- Maximum Caliber -- for characterizing the temporal dynamics of\ncomplex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and inferring\nparameters from temporal data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling,\nMaximum Caliber models the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic\nsystem, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of\nthe Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from\nnear- to far- from-equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs\nincluding random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild competition,\nand non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches.\nFor spatio-temporal data of species occurrence in a metacommunity, the\nparameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple\nlogistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, magnitudes of\ninteractions between species, and effects of intrinsic local environmental\nsuitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes\nand time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias.\nWe introduce entropy production as a system-level measure of disequilibrium,\nand use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize the predictability of the system. We\nshow that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities much better\nthan steady state models, when the system is far from equilibrium. The capacity\nto estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from\nspatio-temporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of\nmetacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and\nrestoration ecology."}

While context-based memory models can explain many\nmemory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over\npossible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that\nfoundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,\nrecurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention\n-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the\nContext Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural\nmachine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their\nconvergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the\nfunctional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to\nmodel human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine\ntranslation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both\ninterpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show\nthat our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns\nas effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate\nadditional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search\nperformance emerges from the interaction of different model components."}

The problem involves a family of finite sets, and the goal is\nto map each non-maximal set to exactly one set that contains it, minimizing the\nsum of uncovered elements across all sets in the family. Hujdurovi\\'c et al.\nformulated the problem in terms of branchings of the digraph formed by the\nproper set inclusion relation on the input sets and studied the problem\ncomplexity based on properties of the corresponding partially ordered set, in\nparticular, with respect to its height and width, defined respectively as the\nmaximum cardinality of a chain and an antichain. They showed that the problem\nis APX-complete for instances of bounded height and that a constant-factor\napproximation algorithm exists for instances of bounded width, but left the\nexact complexity for bounded-width instances open. In this paper, we answer\nthis question by proving that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We\nderive this result by examining the structural properties of optimal solutions\nand reducing the problem to computing maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and\nmaximum weight antichains in partially ordered sets.

Furthermore, we leverage a\nweak-form equation error-based method of parameter estimation for systems with\nunobserved variables to assess practical identifiability far more quickly in\ncomparison to output error-based parameter estimation. We do so by generating\nweak-form input-output equations using differential algebra techniques, as\npreviously proposed by Boulier et al [1], and then applying Weak form\nEstimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) to obtain parameter estimates.

No closed-form formulas for\nthe moments of the projected normal distribution are known, which can limit its\nuse in some applications. In this work, we derive analytic approximations to\nthe first and second moments of the projected normal distribution using Taylor\nexpansions and using results from the theory of quadratic forms of Gaussian\nrandom variables. Then, motivated by applications in systems neuroscience, we\npresent generalizations of the projected normal distribution that divide the\nvariable $\\mathbf{x}$ by a denominator of the form $\\sqrt{\\mathbf{x}^T\n\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{x} + c}$, where $\\mathbf{B}$ is a symmetric positive\ndefinite matrix and $c$ is a non-negative number.

We show that the moments approximations are accurate for a wide\nrange of dimensionalities and distribution parameters. Furthermore, we show\nthat the moments approximations can be used to fit these distributions to data\nthrough moment matching.
