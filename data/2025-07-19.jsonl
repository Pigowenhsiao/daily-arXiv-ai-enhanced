In this work we\nfocus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers)\ncombine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy\nparameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all\ninteractions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded\n(domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different\nways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the\nsaturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model.\nWithin this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer\nconcentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers\nare in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even\nif not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper\nbounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial\narguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to\nreal-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to\ndecreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation.

While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal\npatterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework\napplicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent\noverlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility\nto representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time\npoints, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical\nImage Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).\nGLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation\nextraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation\nextraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and\nemploys a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained\ntemporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The\nprogression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection\narchitecture which integrates the learned progression representation with\ncurrent imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse\nduring cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:\nknee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment\nresponse assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art\nlongitudinal analysis methods.

Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive\nreviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural\nmodules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,\ntheoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We\ndistinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and\nparameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated\nacross a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,\nadaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module\ntends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers\ncapable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may\noffer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy\nefficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust\nembodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such\nsystems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are\nstill lacking.
