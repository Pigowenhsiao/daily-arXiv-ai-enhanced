This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for\nachieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address\nthe issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by\nnon-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line\ninterference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of\nproblematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting\n(ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify\nchannels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR\ntopographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the\nimpact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery\n(MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm,\nreaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%]\n(confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions),\nsignificantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction\n(ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]).

Variational\nLaplace, an iterative update scheme motivated by this objective, is widely used\nin different contexts in the cognitive neuroscience community. However, until\nnow, the theoretical properties of this scheme have not been systematically\ninvestigated. Here, we study variational Laplace in the light of frequentist\nasymptotic statistics.
