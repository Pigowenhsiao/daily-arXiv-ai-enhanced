As such, with this work, we use the structural ensembles generated\nfrom AlphaFold2 at a range of reduced MSA depths to parameterize the potential\nof mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation.\nThis approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us\nto estimate the timescales spanned by the AlphaFold2-generated ensembles at\neach MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we\nconfirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an\nensemble's conformational fluctuations, since the MSA depth essentially serves\nas a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe\ntimescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular\ndynamics simulations.

Gene\nexpression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions\nknown as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in\nEscherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene\nnetworks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent\ndiscoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model\nfor gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by\nmulticellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical\ninteractions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate\nmulticellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby\nproducing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular\ninteraction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks\nduring self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables\nuniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual\ncells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network\noutputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular\ninteraction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages,\nthereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model\nfor reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for\npredictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout\nmulticellular self-organization and development.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction\nshow that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and\ngeneralizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%."}
