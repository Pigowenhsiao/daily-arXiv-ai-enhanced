In this study, we\nsuppressed positive (excitatory) connections within an artificial neural\nnetwork to simulate E/I imbalance.

Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population.\nIndeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot\ndetect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm\nto a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another\nperspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of\nsubjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention\ntrials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of\nprevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which\nrequires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account.\nThe primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different\nmethods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain\nAlzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial\nwith four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite\nZ-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic\nmixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is\ntherefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory\nclassification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal\ndata, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised\nanalysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status.\nResults: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and\none of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up.\nThis method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite\nZ-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised\nmethods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore\nnecessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the\nrate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation\nwas performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the\ngraphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define\nresponder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria.\nDiscussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be\ninconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have\nmasked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta\nAmyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to\nsubject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify\npatterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the\npotential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the\nfinal endpoint considered."}

Distinct stress patterns emerge around topological defects,\ncoinciding with singularities in cell alignment, density, and morphology,\nindicating a strong coupling between mechanical forces and structural\norganization. Moreover, tensile stresses are preferentially transmitted along\nthe cell elongation axis and compressive stresses transversely, demonstrating\nthat local stress guides cell arrangement. This mechanical guidance appears to\nbe universal among contractile systems, as observed also in bone marrow-derived\nmesenchymal stem cells. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework\nfor characterizing mechanical anisotropy in active cellular monolayers and\nreveals a general principle of force-structure coupling, providing a physical\nbasis for understanding how mechanics governs myogenesis, morphogenesis, and\ncollective organization in contractile cellular systems."}

We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in\ncontact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes\nin spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we\nintroduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the\nwhole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange\ninteractions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This\nsetup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical\n(diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics\non the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of\nactivity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time\nchimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable\nmoving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the\nsystem at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's\nphase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence\nof chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform\nstable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and\nincoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as\nit is, e.g., the brain."}

Mapping habitat connectivity takes\ngeographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations\nin biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with\nhigh habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are\ngeographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a\nmajor role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that\nwould otherwise be physically fragmented.\n  Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential\nimportance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes.\ngeohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat\navailability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat\nconnectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or\npollinators.\n  geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network\ncentrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples\nusing geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in\nAfrica and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply\ngeohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated\nimportance of geographic locations for species spread.\n  geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to\nquantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic\nscales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through\nhabitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science,\nand conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary\npathogens, pests, or endangered species."}

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the\nhuman brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which\nunderlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory\nsignals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments."}
