Submitted to ACS Synthetic Biology", "summary": "Codon usage bias has a crucial impact on the translation efficiency and co-translational folding of proteins, necessitating the algorithmic development of codon optimization/harmonization methods, particularly for heterologous recombinant protein expression. Codon harmonization is especially valuable for proteins sensitive to translation rates, because it can potentially replicate native translation speeds, preserving proper folding and maintaining protein activity. This work proposes a Monte Carlo-based codon harmonization algorithm, MOSAIC (Monte Carlo-based Simulated Annealing for Linked Codons), for the harmonization of a set of linked codons, which differs from conventional codon harmonization, by focusing on the codon sets rather than individual ones. Our MOSAIC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ribosomal proteins (S18, S15, S10, and L11) as model systems. Among them, the harmonized gene of RP S18 was expressed and compared with the expression of the wild-type gene. The harmonized gene clearly yielded a larger quantity of the protein, from which the amount of the soluble protein was also significant. These results underscore the potential of the linked codon harmonization approach to enhance the expression and functionality of sensitive proteins, setting the stage for more efficient production of recombinant proteins in various biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications."}

By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging."}

Yet, constructing such problems in a reproducible and accessible manner remains challenging. The PEtab format has established itself as a powerful community standard to encode parameter estimation problems, promoting interoperability and reusability. However, its reliance on multiple interlinked files - often edited manually - can introduce inconsistencies, and new users often struggle to navigate them. Here, we present PEtab-GUI, an open-source Python application designed to streamline the creation, editing, and validation of PEtab problems through an intuitive graphical user interface. PEtab-GUI integrates all PEtab components, including SBML models and tabular files, into a single environment with live error-checking and customizable defaults. Interactive visualization and simulation capabilities enable users to inspect the relationship between the model and the data. PEtab-GUI lowers the barrier to entry for specifying standardized parameter estimation problems, making dynamic modeling more accessible, especially in educational and interdisciplinary settings.\n  Availability and Implementation: PEtab-GUI is implemented in Python, open-source under a 3-Clause BSD license.

However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, Rényi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence."}

Yet in large spatially extended systems, the time to reach species extinction (or fixation) becomes exceedingly long. Tuning control parameters may diminish the survival probability, rendering species coexistence susceptible to stochastic extinction events. In inhomogeneous settings, where a vulnerable subsystem is diffusively coupled to an adjacent stable patch, the former is reanimated through continuous influx from the interfaces, provided the absorbing region sustains spreading activity fronts. We demonstrate this generic elimination of finite-size extinction instabilities via immigration flux in predator-prey, epidemic spreading, and cyclic competition models."}

We propose a formal theory of network energetics explaining how brain states influence sequential behavior. We test our theory on multi-unit recordings from the caudate nucleus and cortical regions of macaques performing a motor habit task. The theory predicts the energy required to transition between brain states represented by trial-specific firing rates across channels, assuming activity spreads through effective connections. We hypothesized that habit formation would correlate with lower control energy. Consistent with this, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions between similar saccade patterns and those of intermediate complexity, and sessions exploiting fewer patterns. Simulations ruled out confounds from neurons' directional tuning. Finally, virtual lesioning demonstrated robustness of observed relationships between control energy and behavior. This work paves the way for examining how behavior arises from changing activity in distributed circuitry."}

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies."}

The social network is constructed by assuming that a group of agents are associated if they have visited the same set of sites within a finite time interval. This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents."}

Beginning from a minimal description of a sensory neuron, a state-space representation of firing rate emerges naturally from Shannon's measure of information. A special case of this formulation predicts a previously unknown inequality governing sensory adaptation, which was confirmed across different modalities, species, and experimental conditions. Further analysis shows that the firing rate behaves like a state function in thermodynamics, leading to an entropy production equation from which a general law follows: any closed cycle of stimulation yields a non-negative net gain of sensory information."}

We constructed a digital blood twin from 103 disease signatures comprising longitudinal hematological and biochemical analytes. Profiles were standardized into a unified disease analyte matrix, and pairwise Pearson correlations were computed to assess similarity. Hierarchical clustering revealed robust grouping of hematopoietic disorders, while metabolic, endocrine, and respiratory diseases were more heterogeneous, reflecting weaker cohesion.\n  To evaluate structure, the tree was cut at a stringent threshold, yielding 16 groups. Enrichment of the largest heterogeneous cluster (Cluster 9) showed convergence on cytokine-signaling pathways, indicating shared immunological and inflammatory mechanisms across clinical boundaries. Dimensionality reduction with PCA and UMAP corroborated these results, consistently separating hematological diseases. Random Forest feature selection identified neutrophils, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell count, and platelets as the most discriminative analytes, reinforcing hematopoietic markers as key drivers.\n  Collectively, these findings show that blood-derived digital signatures can recover clinically meaningful clusters while revealing mechanistic overlaps across categories. The coherence of hematological diseases contrasts with the dispersion of systemic and metabolic disorders, underscoring both the promise and limits of blood-based classification. This framework highlights the potential of integrating routine laboratory data with computational methods to refine disease ontology, map comorbidities, and advance precision diagnostics."}

Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect.

However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs."}

Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency."}

Please cite the AAAI version", "summary": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications."}
