However, these advances\ncome at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive\noperators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,\nwhich collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we\npresent MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold\ntackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle\ntime from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for\nmemory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for\ncommon and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and\nAMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by\nup to 1.23$\\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to\n1.73$\\times$ and 1.62$\\times$ respectively.

However,\nmost existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for\nthe formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To\naddress this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,\nCovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent\nbinding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:\nreactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent\ndocking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,\nwe establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nbenchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular\ntransformations involved in covalent binding.

This paper explores the human niche through\nthe lens of macroecological scaling theory, seeking to define and quantify the\ndimensions along which human ecological strategies have diversified. By\nleveraging concepts from classic niche theory, niche construction, and complex\nadaptive systems, I develop a framework for understanding human ecology as both\npredictable within mammalian scaling relationships and uniquely divergent due\nto social, cognitive, and technological factors. Key dimensions of the human\nniche-metabolism, cognition, sociality, and computation-are examined through\nscaling laws that structure human interactions with the environment and each\nother. The paper demonstrates how human niche expansion over evolutionary time\nhas been characterized by increasing metabolic consumption, information\nprocessing capacity, and the formation of larger, more interconnected social\nnetworks. This cumulative trajectory has led to the unprecedented scale of\ncontemporary human societies, with implications for sustainability, economic\ndevelopment, and future niche expansion, including into space. The study\nunderscores the need for an integrative, quantitative approach to human ecology\nthat situates human adaptability within broader ecological and evolutionary\nconstraints."}

Chronic pain afflicts 20 % of the global population. A strictly\nbiomedical mind-set leaves many sufferers chasing somatic cures and has fuelled\nthe opioid crisis. The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective,\nmultifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We\nhypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to\nengage in psychotherapy.\n  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded\nnarrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived\npain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned,\nembedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into\nmachine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.\n  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity =\n0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model\nyielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75).\nSentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p\n< .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p < .05).\n  Conclusion. Brief spoken pain narratives carry reliable signals of\nwillingness to start psychosocial treatment. NLP-based screening could help\nclinicians match chronic-pain patients to appropriate interventions sooner,\nsupporting a patient-centred biopsychosocial pathway."}

We act strategically in\nnegotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose\nwith whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary\ngame theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over\ntime, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial\nquantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity\nregulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the\nchoice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning\nprocess in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is\noften interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take\nselection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the\nindividuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The\nendpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction\nin place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases\nindefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it\ncan either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching\naltogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection\nstrengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning\nmechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is\nnot only a by-product of cognitive constraints.

Although it is often\nconceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive\nmechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination\narises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task\naversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical\nframework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied\neffectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a\npreregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven\nsessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)\nto the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for\nself-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience\nsampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world\nprocrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term\nretention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a\nlasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a\n6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and\nincreased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a\nstriking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and\nsufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these\nfindings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates\nprocrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not\nby simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a\nprecise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a\nvalidated, theory-driven strategy for intervention."}
