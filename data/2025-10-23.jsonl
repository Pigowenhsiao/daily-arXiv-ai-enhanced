However, current molecular\nlarge language models face significant limitations in understanding molecules\ndue to inadequate textual descriptions and suboptimal molecular representation\nstrategies during pretraining. To address these challenges, we introduce\nKnowMol-100K, a large-scale dataset with 100K fine-grained molecular\nannotations across multiple levels, bridging the gap between molecules and\ntextual descriptions. Additionally, we propose chemically-informative molecular\nrepresentation, effectively addressing limitations in existing molecular\nrepresentation strategies. Building upon these innovations, we develop KnowMol,\na state-of-the-art multi-modal molecular large language model.

Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian\nolfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic\nsystems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing\nmachines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with\nmultimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it\nintroduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated\nby machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the\nscientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of\nmachine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of\na new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We\ncover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some\nof the ethical and legal concerns arising.

High level of prejudice should lead to\ndiscrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In\nthis paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum\ngame which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of\nplayers, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game\ndynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of\nspiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition\n-- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold\nvalue of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes\nprogressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where\ndeterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics,\napproximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is\nalso found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the\nmutation-selection dominated regime."}

This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was\nalso empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on\nclassification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we\nshow that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient\nlearning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We\nshow that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an\nunderlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual\ninformation implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)\nbuilding a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is\nbased on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural\nactivity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural\nFisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the\nsensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an\nexpansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the\nproperties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors\ngive the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We\nfind that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,\nthe class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we\nnumerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices\nmatch, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate\nour approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance\ndecomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own."}
