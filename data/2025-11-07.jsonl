This study\nintroduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel\ntensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance\nclassification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality\nreduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a\nnovel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme\nto iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature\nrepresentation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant\nPARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and\nMI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.\nBenchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the\ntraditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art\nperformance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and\nPARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%\n> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more\nefficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.\nThis offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI\nand broader neuroimaging applications."}

Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive\ncases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal\nequation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to\nthe rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need\nthe distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections.\nIn practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between\nsymptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that\noccurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values,\nwhich can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of\nthe two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the\ndistribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus\ninfinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower\nreproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation.\nHere, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions\nincluding an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences\nof presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections."}

While recent advances have focused\nprimarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the\ndetection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding\nsocial and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation\ntools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,\nor localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this\ngap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both\nfunctionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and\ninteractions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable\nfor training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral\necology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated\napproaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily\nin the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to\nannotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic\nscene graphs.

Shannon\nentropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information\nencoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,\nand Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information\nencoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding\nsimilarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is\npreferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more\nfundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a\nquantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks\nsimply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;\nnevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each\nother."}

This\nreview demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable\ntechnologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic\nphenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage\nhigh-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance\ntests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell\nfunction. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,\nwhere an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to\nstandardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus\ngrapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,\nintegrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical\nactivity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with\nspecific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.\nThe efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be\nphenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can\ndeconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable\nsubphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the\nway for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies\ntailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for\na new era of precision diabetes prevention."}

As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they\nmight achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the\nneurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which\nstores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose\nextensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model\nof memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in\ncontemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that\nthe weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated\nindividual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,\nextending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning\nregime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as\nmeasured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)\nMHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary\nlanguage models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs\nand their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error\nsignals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the\nlearned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we\nshow how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional\noutcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards\nunderstanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations\nthat have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior\nmodels have been able to achieve."}
