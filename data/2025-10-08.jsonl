Accurate\nidentification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development\nof therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on\nmodeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and\ndifficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a\nsequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from\nprotein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and\nachieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current\nmethods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions\nyields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks\nsuch as affinity prediction, binder classification, and epitope binning.\nApplied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific\nsomatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a\npotential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based\nparatope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent\napproaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution."}

An ordinary differential equation model is\ndeveloped to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection,\nincorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity,\nhumoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis\nreveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and\nintrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up\nto five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease\nstates may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation\nmainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the\ncomplexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure\ndemonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6\nlevels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression\nshow delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period\nand disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute\nresponse to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role,\nwhile immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune\nself-activation.

In this context, inhibiting factors such as\ninterference, predator competition, and the introduction of temporally\ndependent quantity and quality of additional food are all known to enable pest\nextinction. As climate change and habitat degradation have increasing effects\nin enhancing patchiness in ecological systems, the effect of additional food in\npatch models has also been recently considered. However, the question of\ncomplete pest extinction in such patchy systems remains open. In the current\nmanuscript, we consider a biological control model where additional food drives\ncompetition among predators in one patch, and they subsequently disperse to a\nneighboring patch via drift or dispersal. We show that complete pest extinction\nin both patches is possible. Further, this state is proved to be globally\nasymptotically stable under certain parametric restrictions. We also prove a\ncodimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We discuss our results in the\ncontext of designing pest management strategies under enhanced climate change\nand habitat fragmentation. Such strategies are particularly relevant to control\ninvasive pests such as the Soybean aphid (\\emph{Aphis glycines}), in the North\nCentral United States."}

The main questions of\ninterest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence,\nand positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the\ntransient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer\ntypes; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the\npolymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these\nquestions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical\narguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the\ntechniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process\nwith finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used\nand developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex\nmodels in the future."}

This body of theory can accommodate\na range of social dilemmas, or games, as well as real-world complexities such\nas spatial structure or behaviors conditioned on reputations. Nonetheless, this\napproach typically assumes a deterministic payoff structure for social\ninteractions. Here, we extend evolutionary game theory to account for random\nchanges in the social environment, so that mutual cooperation may bring\ndifferent rewards today than it brings tomorrow, for example. Even when such\nenvironmental noise is unbiased, we find it can have a qualitative impact on\nthe behaviors that evolve in a population. Noisy payoffs can permit the stable\nco-existence of cooperators and defectors in the prisoner's dilemma, for\nexample, as well as bistability in snowdrift games and stable limit cycles in\nrock-paper-scissors games -- dynamical phenomena that cannot occur in the\nabsence of noise. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our framework to\nscenarios where the nature of social interactions is subject to external\nperturbations."}

Here, we review three\nmain classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),\nneural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),\nhighlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin\nwith PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have\nbeen successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,\nand medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer\ncontinuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,\npharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful\ntools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient\nsimulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.\nThroughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data\nscarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning\ninsufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions\nfor advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of\nuncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large\nlanguage models."}

High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell\ncultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,\nthese insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per\nexperiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell\nsegmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data\nvolumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study\nsingle-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful\ntools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support\nroutine application in biological research. In this work, we present\nacia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the\nAutomated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the\nmodular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning\nsegmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image\nanalysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations\ninto a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and\nscalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows\nshowcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world\napplications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various\ntypes of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to\nprecise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells\nresponses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten\napplication workflows is open source and publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows."}
