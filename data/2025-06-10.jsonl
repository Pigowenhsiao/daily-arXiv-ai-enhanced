In the first stage, we introduce a molecular\nalignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the\nligand, using the template structure as a reference.

ProteinZero employs a general RL framework\nbalancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and\na novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode\ncollapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing\nmethods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant\nimprovements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,\nand sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure\nrates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like\nProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates\nexceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL\nrun on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,\nincluding reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein\ndesign where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,\nopening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space."}

While such diversity is a\nhallmark of biological networks, its computational role in nonlinear\ninformation processing remains elusive. In this study, we examine how\nheterogeneity in intrinsic neural timescales within the frontal cortex - a\nregion central to cognitive control - enhances performance in a\ncontext-dependent working memory task. We develop a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) composed of units with distinct time constants to model a delayed\nmatch-to-sample task with contextual cues. This task demands nonlinear\nintegration of temporally dispersed inputs and flexible behavioral adaptation.\nOur analysis shows that task performance is optimized when fast and slow\ntimescales are appropriately balanced. Intriguingly, slow neurons, despite\nweaker encoding of task-relevant inputs, play a causal role in sustaining\nmemory and improving performance. In contrast, fast neurons exhibit strong but\ntransient encoding of input signals. These results highlight a division of\ncomputational roles among neurons with different timescales: slow dynamics\nsupport stable internal states, while fast dynamics enable rapid signal\nencoding. Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how temporal\nheterogeneity contributes to nonlinear information processing in neural\ncircuits, shedding light on the dynamic architecture underlying cognitive\nflexibility."}

To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) the \\textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}\nmechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular\ngraphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric\nprinciple of \\textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses\nthe mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded\nannotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a\nlarge-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,\nand introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained\nevaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist\nmodels, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in\nscenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,\nGTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage\npoints, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics.

Recent\nmodels trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.\nUsing NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on\nmental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement\nbecause mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower\nsignal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to\nmental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and\nbrain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally\ngenerated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source\nvisual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et\nal.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on\nmental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.\nWe further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact\ncross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding\narchitectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental\nimagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data.

These rules, often approximating gradient descent\nlearning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two\ncritical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good\nneuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While\nextensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains\nunderexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known\nneuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically\nplausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation\nand has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can\nachieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time\n(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy.

The results\nshowed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped\nwith the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct\nsaccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked\napproximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In\nthe frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency\nsynchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was\nrobust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions.
