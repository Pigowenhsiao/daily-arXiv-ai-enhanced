While graph-based methods have achieved\nstrong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,\noverlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.\nAdditionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction\nnetworks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic\ninsights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework\nthat integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable\nDDI prediction.

To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces\ntwo domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling\n(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and\nattention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential\nmolecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information\nminimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding\nfusion.

As these\necosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,\nhigh-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and\nrestoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial\nresolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types\nthat co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that\ncomplicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote\nsensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat\nclassification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using\nvegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3\nEUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against\nindependent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical\nnature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially\nin fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation\nmodels, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.\nFinally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted\naccuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe\nand adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance\ntemporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and\nquality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with\nhigher-quality in-situ observations."}

To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search\nstrategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary\nfamily of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective\nstrategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining\ngraph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for\nintermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network\npotential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate\nreaction pathway.

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method\nfor decomposing nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics into several basic dynamics\n(dynamic modes; DMs) with intrinsic frequencies and decay rates. In particular,\nunlike Fourier transform-based methods, which are used to decompose a\nsingle-channel signal into the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves with discrete\nfrequencies at a regular interval, DMD can derive the intrinsic frequencies of\na multichannel signal on the basis of the available data; furthermore, it can\ncapture nonstationary components such as alternations between states with\ndifferent intrinsic frequencies. Here, we propose the use of the distribution\nof intrinsic frequencies derived from DMDs (DM frequencies) to characterise\nneural activities. The distributions of DM frequencies in the\nelectroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or\nParkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated. By using the\ndistributions, these patients were distinguished from healthy subjects with\nsignificantly greater accuracy than when using amplitude spectra derived by\ndiscrete Fourier transform. This finding suggests that the distribution of DM\nfrequencies exhibits distinct behaviour from amplitude spectra, and therefore,\nthe distribution may serve as a new biomarker by characterising the nonlinear\nspatiotemporal dynamics of electrophysiological signals."}

The measures\nto be adopted require carefully weighing the social cost against their impact\non disease control. In this work, we analyze, in a context of mobility\nrestrictions, the role of frequent versus occasional contacts in epidemic\nspread. We develop an individual-based mathematical model where frequent\ncontacts among individuals (at home, work, schools) and occasional contacts (at\nstores, transport, etc.) are considered. We define several contact structures\nby changing the relative weight between frequent and occasional contacts while\nkeeping the same initial effective rate of spread. We find the remarkable\nresult that the more frequent contacts prevail over occasional ones, the higher\nthe epidemic peak, the sooner it occurs, and the greater the final number of\nindividuals affected by the epidemic. We conduct our study using an SIR model,\nconsidering both exponential and deterministic recovery from infection, and\nobtain that this effect is more pronounced under deterministic recovery. We\nfind that the impact of relaxation measures depends on the relative importance\nof frequent and occasional contacts within the considered social structures.\nFinally, we assess in which of the considered scenarios the homogeneous mixing\napproximation provides a reasonable description of the epidemic dynamics."}

Here, we derive a\ntheory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of\nnetworks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By\ndirectly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that\nall fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the\nclassical \\textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural\nactivities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation\nfunction.
