A paradigmatic example are\nsynaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different\nmechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms,\nthe role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the\nso-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the\ncompetition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have\nyet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the\ntripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in\nshort-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and\npre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability\nof neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term\nplasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a\nminimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation\nthat propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit\nis highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to\nexternal input.

For the\nstructural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based\nmetrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,\nanchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the\nsemantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing\nobjects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,\nenabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth\nstimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple\nstimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.\nTogether, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and\ncomprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods."}
