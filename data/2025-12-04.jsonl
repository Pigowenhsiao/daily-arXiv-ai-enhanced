We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method."}

However, pan-cancer research still faces two key challenges: learning discriminative and efficient single-cell representations, and establishing a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we introduce PanFoMa, a lightweight hybrid neural network that combines the strengths of Transformers and state-space models to achieve a balance between performance and efficiency. PanFoMa consists of a front-end local-context encoder with shared self-attention layers to capture complex, order-independent gene interactions; and a back-end global sequential feature decoder that efficiently integrates global context using a linear-time state-space model. This modular design preserves the expressive power of Transformers while leveraging the scalability of Mamba to enable transcriptome modeling, effectively capturing both local and global regulatory signals. To enable robust evaluation, we also construct a large-scale pan-cancer single-cell benchmark, PanFoMaBench, containing over 3.5 million high-quality cells across 33 cancer subtypes, curated through a rigorous preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results show that PanFoMa outperforms state-of-the-art models on our pan-cancer benchmark (+4.0\\%) and across multiple public tasks, including cell type annotation (+7.4\\%), batch integration (+4.0\\%) and multi-omics integration (+3.1\\%).

We determine here whether variations in light, microclimatic conditions and host tree size affect the variation in species composition and phylogenetic structure of epiphytic bryophyte communities, and hence, assess the contribution of environmental filtering, phylogenetic constraints and competition to community assembly.A canopy crane giving access to 1.1 ha of tropical rainforest in Yunnan (China) was employed to record hourly light and microclimatic conditions from 54 dataloggers and epiphytic bryophyte communities from 408 plots. Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was implemented to analyse the relationship between taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among epiphytic communities, host-tree characteristics and microclimatic variation.Within-tree vertical turnover of bryophyte communities was significantly about 30% higher than horizontal turnover among-trees. Thus, the sharp vertical variations in microclimatic conditions from tree base to canopy are more important than differences in age, reflecting the likelihood of colonization, area, and habitat conditions between young and old trees, in shaping the composition of epiphytic bryophyte communities."}

However, this framework, which often assumes a universal critical point, fails to account for the extensive individual variability observed in neural dynamics and cognitive functions. These variabilities are not noise but rather an inherent manifestation of a fundamental systems-biology principle: the necessary trade-off between robustness and flexibility in human populations. Here, we propose that the Griffiths phase (GP), an extended critical regime synergically induced by two kinds of heterogeneities in brain network region and connectivity, offers a unified framework for brain criticality that better reconciles robustness and flexibility and accounts for individual variability. Using Human Connectome Project data and whole-brain modeling, we demonstrated that the synergic interplay between structural network modularity and regional heterogeneity in local excitability yields biologically viable GP featured with widely extended global excitability ranges, with an embedded optimal point that balances global/local information transmission. Crucially, an individua's position within the GP gives rise to unique global network dynamics, which in turn confer a distinctive cognitive profile via flexible configuration of functional connectivity for segregation, integration, and balance between them. These results establish GP as an evolved adaptive mechanism resolving the robustness-flexibility trade-off, fulfilling diverse cognitive demands through individualized criticality landscapes, providing a new framework of brain criticality."}

Contacts were defined by spatial thresholds (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration, enabling the generation of detailed contact matrices. Simulation results showed that low and medium care residents experienced the highest frequency of interactions, particularly with staff on morning and afternoon shifts, while high care residents and night staff had substantially fewer contacts. Contact rates varied significantly by care level and shift, confirmed through Poisson-based regression modelling. Temporal analyses revealed clustering of high-risk contacts during structured daily routines, especially communal and care activities. An integrated airborne transmission module, seeded with a single infectious staff member, demonstrated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents. Vaccination scenarios reduced predicted transmission by up to 68\\%, with the greatest impact observed when both staff and residents were vaccinated. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for contact heterogeneity in aged care and demonstrate the utility of ABMs for evaluating targeted infection control strategies in high-risk, enclosed environments."}

In this work, we explore the emergence of complex spatiotemporal patterns in a large scale-brain model composed of 90 interconnected brain regions coupled through empirically derived anatomical connectivity. An important aspect of our formulation is that the local dynamics of each brain region are described by a next-generation neural mass model, which explicitly captures the macroscopic gamma activity of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neural populations (PING mechanism). We first identify the system's homogeneous states-both resting and oscillatory-and analyze their stability under uniform perturbations. Then, we determine the stability against non-uniform perturbations by obtaining dispersion relations for the perturbation growth rate. This analysis enables us to link unstable directions of the homogeneous solutions to the emergence of rich spatiotemporal patterns, that we characterize by means of Lyapunov exponents and frequency spectrum analysis. Our results show that, compared to previous studies with classical neural mass models, next-generation neural mass models provide a broader dynamical repertoire, both within homogeneous states and in the heterogeneous regime. Additionally, we identify a key role for anatomical connectivity in cross-frequency coupling, allowing for the emergence of gamma oscillations with amplitude modulated by slower rhythms. These findings suggest that such models are not only more biophysically grounded but also particularly well-suited to capture the full complexity of large-scale brain dynamics. Overall, our study advances the analytical understanding of emerging spatiotemporal patterns in whole-brain models."}

A key component of CF management over the past half century has been the treatment of PEx to slow lung function decline. This has been credited with improvements in survival for people with CF (PwCF), but there is no consensus on the optimal approach to PEx management. BEAT-CF (Bayesian evidence-adaptive treatment of CF) was established to build an evidence-informed knowledge base for CF management. The BEAT-CF causal model is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and Bayesian network (BN) for PEx that aims to inform the design and analysis of clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of alternative approaches to PEx management. The causal model describes relationships between background risk factors, treatments, and pathogen colonisation of the airways that affect the outcome of an individual PEx episode. The key factors, outcomes, and causal relationships were elicited from CF clinical experts and together represent current expert understanding of the pathophysiology of a PEx episode, guiding the design of data collection and studies and enabling causal inference. Here, we present the DAG that documents this understanding, along with the processes used in its development, providing transparency around our trial design and study processes, as well as a reusable framework for others."}

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration)."}

We introduce a unified mathematical framework, the Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL) method, for parameter estimation in systems exhibiting heterogeneous or chaotic dynamics, encompassing both pattern formation models and individual-based models. Departing from classical Bayesian inverse problem methodologies, we motivate the development of the CIL method, demonstrate its versatility, and highlight illustrative applications within mathematical biology.

Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems."}

BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability.

However, analytical methods have not kept pace with these imaging advances. This study applied topological data analysis (TDA) to extract biomechanically relevant features from high-resolution bone images, offering a new framework for bone strength prediction. We extracted topological features, specifically those derived from persistent homology, and combined them with standard bone morphometric descriptors to train machine learning models for apparent strength prediction. Models based solely on topological features outperformed those using traditional morphometrics, highlighting TDA's ability to capture biomechanically relevant structure. In particular, internal voids, often dismissed as imaging noise, proved to be the most predictive.

In this paper, we propose the use of a conditional density estimator, augmented with a graph neural network, to perform inference on a flexible mixture of network-forming mechanisms. This event-wise mixture-of-mechanisms model assigns mechanisms to each edge formation event rather than stipulating node-level mechanisms, thus allowing for an explanation of the network generation process, as well as the dynamic evolution of the network over time. We demonstrate that our approximate Bayesian approach yields valid inferences for the relative weights of the mechanisms in our model, and we utilize this method to investigate the mechanisms behind the formation of a variety of real-world networks."}
