That\nwork showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background\ndimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the\ncorresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of\ntime not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the\nstructure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic,\nconvex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures\nrender its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time\nintervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time\nelapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as\nthe SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their\nlineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological\nform, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a\nbiologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of\nduration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly\nopen to experimental validation."}

Although drug treatment initially induces a reduction in\ntumor burden, treatment failure frequently occurs over time due to the\nemergence of drug resistance, ultimately leading to cancer recurrence. To model\nthis process, we employ a two-type branching process with state-dependent\ngrowth rates. The model assumes an initial tumor population composed\npredominantly of drug-sensitive cells, with a small subpopulation of resistant\ncells. Sensitive cells may acquire resistance through mutation, which is\ncoupled to a change in cellular fitness. Furthermore, the growth rates of\nresistant cells are modulated by the overall tumor burden. Using stochastic\ndifferential equation techniques, we establish a functional law of large\nnumbers for the scaled populations of sensitive cells, resistant cells, and the\ninitial resistant clone. We then define the stochastic recurrence time as the\nfirst time the total tumor population regrows to its initial size following\ntreatment. For this recurrence time, as well as for measures of clonal\ndiversity and the size of the largest resistant clone at recurrence, we derive\ncorresponding law of large number limits.

Wu"], "title": "Some Further Developments on a Neurobiologically-based Model for Color Sensations in Humans", "categories": ["q-bio.NC"], "comment": null, "summary": "At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic\ncolor sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations\nto V1-L4: the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this\npaper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that\ndirectly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and\ngreen. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the\nthree-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism.\nRegarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit\na gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to\nits innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the\nproposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds\nwith the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the\nneurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color\nblindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are\nlost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia\nmanifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular\nagnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware\nof which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the\nnature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for\nhuman color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering\nefforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences."}

Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion\nprocess to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to\nphysically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and\ndiffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift\nand driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and\ncaptures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.\n  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival\nmodels, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive\naccuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a\nphysics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation\nbetween input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory\nand deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena\nin complex systems."}

However,\nthe complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG\nsignals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural\nstates, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective\ncross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover\ncomplementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,\nwe propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a\nunified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable\nconversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the\nfirst cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model\ndemonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,\nopen-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering\nvaluable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of\ngeneral-purpose EEG models."}

This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot\nRare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)\nfew-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited\npatient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device\ndropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with\ncalibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike\nprior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a\nmodular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental\nevaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%\nimprovement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client\ndropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,\nprivacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These\nfindings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy\nfederated diagnosis of rare conditions."}

Here we propose a novel method for this\ntask, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.\nThe method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise\ntime series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and\nsupports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of\nautoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated\nand experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing\ninterval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the\ndeterministic models with equivalent architecture."}
