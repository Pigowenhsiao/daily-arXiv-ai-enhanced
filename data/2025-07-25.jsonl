In this study, carbon\nnanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization\n(HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source\nfor carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization\nresulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1\nmicrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples\nresulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The\npositive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different\nfunctional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing\naromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the\nother hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the\nlowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures.\nACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials\nwith a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The\nhigh surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high\nadsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using\nSEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation\nof clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with\nnegative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering\napplications."}

Arrhenotoky is a form of asexual reproduction in which\nunfertilized eggs become males while fertilized eggs develop into females,\nleading to unusual patterns of genetic relatedness between family members. This\nmode of reproduction occurs in insects such as the Hymenoptera, including bees.\nIn the hive environment, bees often display altruistic behavior, or actions\ntaken by an organism that reduce its own fitness to increase the fitness of\nothers. Eusociality, an elaborate form of social organization characterized by\ncomplex and altruistic social behaviors, is also observed in the Hymenoptera.\nTo explore the interplay between altruism and the reproductive patterns of\narrhenotoky, we employ a population dynamics model to simulate beehive\npopulations over a range of parameters, controlling for altruism in workers and\nthe queen. Our results show that altruistic behaviors are essential for beehive\nsuccess, with optimal worker altruism corresponding to the division of labor\nobserved in eusocial species. Furthermore, we find that modest altruism from\nthe queen is also vital for hive survival, emphasizing the delicate balance\nthat can exist in these complex social systems.
