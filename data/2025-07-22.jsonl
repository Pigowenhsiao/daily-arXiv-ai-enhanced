In so-called inverse\nprotein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts\na target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict\nsequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly\nwith complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these\nchallenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein\nfolding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing\nprotein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP\nprogressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural\ncontext during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein\ncomplexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states.\nFurthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling,\nwhich allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the\ndesigned sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance\nof ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or\nmetal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were\ndetermined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse\nfolding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ADFLIP."}

The populations are coupled via delayed cross-inhibition and\nperiodically forced with sharp step-type signals (the two-tone stream). We\ntrack how the perception boundary depends on threshold selection and establish\nhow boundaries between three different auditory perceptions (single tone versus\ntwo tones versus bistability between both perceptions) relate to bifurcations\nsuch as symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these transitions are governed\nby symmetry-breaking bifurcations and that the perceptual classification based\non neural thresholds is highly sensitive to threshold choice. Our analysis\nreveals that a fixed threshold is insufficient to capture the true perceptual\nboundaries and proposes a variable-threshold criterion, informed by the\namplitude dynamics of neural responses.

If languages are already\noptimally effective means of organization and communication of thought, why do\nthey change? And if they are driven to become optimally effective in the\nfuture, why do they change so slowly, and why do they diversify, rather than\nconverge towards an optimum? We look here at the hypothesis that disorder,\nrather than efficiency, may play a dominant role. Most traditional approaches\nto study diachronic language dynamics emphasize lexical data, but a crucial\ncontribution to the effectiveness of a thought-coding device is given by its\ncore structure, its syntax. Based on the reduction of syntax to a set of binary\nparameters, we introduce here a model of natural language change in which\ndiachronic dynamics are mediated by disordered interactions between parameters,\neven in the idealized limit of identical external inputs. We show in which\nregion of `phase space' such dynamics show the glassy features that are\nobserved in natural languages. In particular, syntactic vectors remain trapped\nin glassy metastable (tendentially stable) states when the degree of asymmetry\nin the disordered interactions is below a critical value, consistent with\nstudies of spin glasses with asymmetric interactions. We further show that an\nadded Hopfield-type memory term, would indeed, if strong enough, stabilize\nsyntactic configurations even above the critical value, but losing the\nmultiplicity of stable states. Finally, using a notion of linguistic distance\nin syntactic space we show that a phylogenetic signal may remain among related\nlanguages, despite their gradually divergent syntax, exactly as recently\npointed out for real-world languages.

Increased sodium entry through $\\alpha$7-5HT3-R upon\nstimulation with uPSEM-817 (uPharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule-817)\nled to cell membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels,\nand increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, resulting in the stimulation\nof CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone biosynthesis. Increased\nintracellular sodium influx did not increase proliferation but rather induced\napoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS: H295R-S2 $\\alpha$7-5HT3-R cells\nare a new model reproducing the major features of cells harboring KCNJ5\nmutations. Increased expression of CYP11B2 and stimulation of the\nmineralocorticoid biosynthesis pathway are associated with a decrease of cell\nproliferation and an increase of apoptosis, indicating that additional events\nmay be required for the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas."}

However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an\nopen-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point\ntracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos.

Bifurcation\nanalysis and simulations of canonical mean-field network models, including\nWilson--Cowan, Tsodyks--Markram, and Jansen--Rit frameworks, show that this\nbifurcation structure emerges robustly across models. We demonstrate that the\ninterplay between external input and (synaptic) connectivity converges onto\nthis shared mechanism, providing a fundamental principle for understanding how\ndiverse brain states arise and are regulated. Beyond phenomenological\nmean-field models, we show that a shared mathematical structure of nonlinear\ninput-output relationships, rather than model-specific details, preserves the\norganising centre across frameworks, revealing a general mechanism for dynamic\nstate transitions."}

This version has been accepted as a full paper\n  at the 2025 AI in Healthcare (AIiH) Conference", "summary": "Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of\ncauses. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side\neffects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for\nimproved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the\neffects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting\nclinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.\nHowever, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this\nproject attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals\nexperiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks\nare derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG\nchannels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the\nmajor brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)\nmodel is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with\ninsomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance.\nResults indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most\nsuitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification\naccuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the\nomission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in\nmodel performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes\nare positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of\nfunctional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such\nresults."}
