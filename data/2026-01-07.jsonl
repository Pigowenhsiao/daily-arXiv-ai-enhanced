We analyze the static sensing limits of mixed Tar/Tsr chemoreceptor clusters in individual Escherichia coli cells using a heterogeneous Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. By sweeping a seven-dimensional parameter space, we compute three sensing performance metrics-channel capacity, effective Hill coefficient, and dynamic range. Across E. coli-like parameter regimes, we consistently observe pronounced local maxima of channel capacity, whereas neither the effective Hill coefficient nor the dynamic range exhibit comparable optimization. The capacity-achieving input distribution is bimodal, which implies that individual cells maximize information by sampling both low- and high concentration regimes. Together, these results suggest that, at the individual-cell level, channel capacity may be selected for in E. coli receptor clusters."}

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences."}

However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, only a small number of three-dimensional quadratic CDSs with chaos are reported, all of which have at least 9 monomials and at least 3 quadratics, with CRNs containing at least 7 reactions and at least 3 quadratic ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics. At the CRN level, some of these systems have 4 reactions of which only 3 are quadratic, or 5 reactions with only 2 being quadratic. These results quantify structural complexity of chaotic CDSs, and indicate that they are ubiquitous."}

Demographic eco-evolutionary game dynamics under the impact of the delay resulting from the offspring maturation time", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "nlin.CD"], "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we extend the demographic eco-evolutionary game approach, based on explicit birth and death dynamics instead of abstract \"fitness\" interpreted as an abstract \"Malthusian parameter\", by the introduction of the delay resulting from the juvenile maturation time. This leads to the application of the Delay Differential Equations (DDE). We show that delay seriously affects the resulting dynamics and may lead to the loss of stability of equilibria when critical delay is exceeded. We provide theoretical tools for the assessment of the critical delays and the parameter values when this may happen. Our results emphasize the importance of the mechanisms of density dependence. We analyze the impact of three different suppression modes based on: adult mortality, juvenile recruitment survival after the maturation period (without delay), and juvenile recruitment at birth (with the delay). The last mode leads to extreme patterns such as bifurcations, complex cycles, and chaotic dynamics. However, surprisingly, this mode leads to extension of the duration of the temporary transient metastable states known as \"ghost attractors\". In addition, we also focus on the problem of resilience of the analyzed systems against external periodic perturbations and feedback-driven factors such as additional predator pressure."}

Its leaves and fruits are important food sources for birds and mammals, and the species is traditionally used by Indigenous peoples of Central and South America to treat intestinal parasites, gingivitis, internal inflammation, and snakebites. Despite its medicinal relevance, studies on its chemistry and biological properties are still limited. This work aimed to characterize the chemical constituents of F. maxima leaves and stem bark using UPLC-MS-MS and to evaluate the antinociceptive activity and CYP1A inhibition of ethanolic extracts and fractions. Plant material collected in Abaetetuba, Para (October 2013), was extracted and fractionated by silica gel column chromatography. UPLC-MS-MS analyses in positive and negative ion modes enabled putative metabolite identification supported by MS/MS libraries and molecular networking on GNPS. A total of 45 metabolites were identified, including flavonoids, triterpenes, coumarins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and alkaloids. Major constituents in the leaf extract included triterpene 51, flavonoids 75 and 70, and alkaloid 29. The stem bark ethanolic extract showed marked antinociceptive activity in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (muscarinic pathway) and 62.6 +/- 9.2% activity in the hot-plate test (opioid pathway). The dichloromethane fraction of the leaves exhibited potent CYP1A1 inhibitory activity in vitro. These findings support the traditional use of F. maxima as an anti-inflammatory resource and associate its major constituents with the observed activities, reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic source that deserves further investigation."}

For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models."}

While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding \"what\" happened \"when\" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition."}

Wood"], "title": "Transformers self-organize like newborn visual systems when trained in prenatal worlds", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Do transformers learn like brains? A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially \"trained\" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles."}

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."}

Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans."}
