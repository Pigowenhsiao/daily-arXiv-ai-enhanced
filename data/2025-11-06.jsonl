However, a major cause of design failures is the\ninability to find solutions within realistic time limits. Therefore, it is\nessential to develop methods that achieve a high success rate within the\nspecified computation time. In this study, we propose a framework for ranking\nthe importance of individual genes to accelerate the solution of the original\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in the design of\nconstraint-based models. In the proposed method, after pre-assigning values to\nhighly important genes, the MILPs are solved in parallel as a series of\nmutually exclusive subproblems. It is found that our framework was able to\nrecover most of the successful cases identified by the original approach and\nachieved a 37% to 186% increase in success rate compared to the original method\nwithin the same time limits. Analysis of the MILP solution process revealed\nthat the proposed method reduced the sizes of subproblems and decreased the\nnumber of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. This framework for ranking gene\nimportance can be directly applicable to a range of MILP-based algorithms for\nthe design of constraint-based metabolic networks.

The Reduction Principle states that, near a\nmutation--selection balance where $M_1$ is fixed with mutation rate $u_1$, a\nrare allele $M_2$ can invade if its associated rate $u_2$ is lower than $u_1$.\nThis result, valid for both haploids and diploids, assumes constant mutation\nrates through time.

Summary methods like MP-EST, ASTRAL2, and ASTRID infer species trees\nfrom gene trees but suffer when gene tree accuracy is low. To address this, the\nStatistical Binning (SB) and Weighted Statistical Binning (WSB) pipelines were\ndeveloped to improve gene tree estimation. However, previous studies only\ntested these pipelines using multi-locus bootstrapping (MLBS), not the BestML\napproach.\n  This thesis proposes a novel pipeline, WSB+WQMC, which shares design features\nwith the existing WSB+CAML pipeline but has other desirable properties and is\nstatistically consistent under the GTR+MSC model. This study evaluated WSB+WQMC\nagainst WSB+CAML using BestML analysis on various simulated datasets. The\nresults confirmed many trends seen in prior MLBS analyses. WSB+WQMC\nsubstantially improved gene tree and species tree accuracy (using ASTRAL2 and\nASTRID) on most datasets with low, medium, and moderately high ILS levels. In a\ndirect comparison, WSB+WQMC computed less accurate trees than WSB+CAML under\ncertain low and medium ILS conditions. However, WSB+WQMC performed better or at\nleast as accurately as WSB+CAML on all datasets with moderately high and high\nILS. It also proved better for estimating gene trees on some medium and low ILS\ndatasets. Thus, WSB+WQMC is a promising alternative to WSB+CAML for\nphylogenetic estimation, especially in the presence of low phylogenetic signal."}

Using a Lyapunov functional approach, we derive a\nsufficient condition, Rs0>1 for the existence of a stationary distribution,\nwhich indicates disease persistence. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate\nthat the disease will die out at an exponential rate if Re0<1 . Our results\nshow that random fluctuations will facilitate disease outbreak."}
