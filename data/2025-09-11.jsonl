In this work, we investigate the potential of\nActivation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text\ngeneration in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating\nprotein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective\nmethod that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this\napproach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification\nmodule. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation\nand optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated\ninto both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional\ntraining.

Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR\nstructures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key\nstructural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited\ncoverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.\nHere we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody\nloop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is\ntrained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar\nbackbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently\nretrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody\ndatabase, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by\n5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue\nof canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop\nconformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that\nthey can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and\nIglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM\noutperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen\ntargets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art\nsequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to\nmodels with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which\nare diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art\nantibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing\nmultimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of\nantibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR\ndesign."}

This study is concerned with a recently\nproposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous\nprocess, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of\ncells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects\nthe cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly\nexpressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications\nare not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing\nselection, functioning as somatic \"experiments\" through which evolution\nexplores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental,\nleading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small\nsubset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape\nfuture developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood\nas evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major\ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders,\nand metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely\ncorrelational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development\nand ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to\nepigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no\nconsistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas\nwidespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this\nperspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate\nsource of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most\nage-related pathologies."}
