Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies."}

For example, energy-based models for protein design are sampled at an artificially low ''temperature'' to generate novel, functional sequences. This temperature tuning is a common yet poorly understood heuristic used across machine learning contexts to control the trade-off between generative fidelity and diversity. Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects. More generally, we characterize how the optimal sampling temperature depends on the interplay between data size and the system's underlying energy landscape. Crucially, our results show that lowering the sampling temperature is not always desirable; we identify the conditions where \\emph{raising} it results in better generative performance. Our framework thus casts post-hoc temperature tuning as a diagnostic tool that reveals properties of the true data distribution and the limits of the learned model."}

These frameworks frequently fail to capture the intrinsic non-linear dynamics and posture-dependent dependencies of biological systems. To address this, we present a computational framework that maps kinematic data onto a Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Using the Log-Euclidean metric, we transformed raw skeletal pose sequences into geometric feature vectors to quantify gait variability and smoothness across three velocity profiles: slow, medium, and fast. Our comparative analysis reveals a critical divergence between geometric approaches. While Euclidean metrics exhibit a strictly linear increase in variability with speed (Slow < Medium < Fast), implying instability, the proposed Riemannian metrics reveal a non-linear \"inverted-U'' pattern with varying speeds. Specifically, we observed a stabilization of variance at high speeds (sprinting), suggesting that the motor system optimizes efficiency by adhering to geodesic trajectories of minimum effort. These findings demonstrate that manifold-based representations offer superior sensitivity to biomechanical efficiency compared to standard linear methods, providing a robust foundation for future diagnostic algorithms and explainable machine learning models in clinical biomechanics."}

However, recent human and non-human primate research suggests the existence of a third visual pathway projecting from early visual cortex through the motion-selective area V5/MT into the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here we integrate anatomical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence demonstrating that this pathway specializes in processing dynamic social cues such as facial expressions, eye gaze, and body movements. This third pathway supports social perception by computing the actions and intentions of other people. These findings enhance our understanding of visual cortical organization and highlight the STS's critical role in social cognition, suggesting that visual processing encompasses a dedicated neural circuit for interpreting socially relevant motion and behavior."}

Current stochastic models often either assume independent and identical behavior of individual agents or incorporate only spatiotemporal inhomogeneity, ignoring the effect of genealogy-based inhomogeneity on the long-time behavior of these processes. Such long-time asymptotics are of independent mathematical interest and are crucial in understanding the effect of patterns. We propose several inhomogeneous BRW models in 2D space where displacement distributions and branching rates vary with time, space, and genealogy. A combined model then uses a weighted average of positions given by these separate models to study the shape of the growth patterns. Using computer simulations, we tune parameters from these models, which are based on genealogical and spatiotemporal factors, observe the resulting structures, and compare them with images of real bacterial colonies."}

In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \\textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits."}

While various computational methods have achieved empirical success in correcting these effects, they lack the formal theoretical guarantees required to assess their reliability and generalization. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mixture-Model-based Data Harmonization (MoDaH), a principled batch correction algorithm grounded in a rigorous statistical framework.\n  Under a new Gaussian-mixture-model with explicit parametrization of batch effects, we establish the minimax optimal error rates for batch correction and prove that MoDaH achieves this rate by leveraging the recent theoretical advances in clustering data from anisotropic Gaussian mixtures. This constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantee for batch correction. Extensive experiments on diverse single-cell RNA-seq and spatial proteomics datasets demonstrate that MoDaH not only attains theoretical optimality but also achieves empirical performance comparable to or even surpassing those of state-of-the-art heuristics (e.g., Harmony, Seurat-V5, and LIGER), effectively balancing the removal of technical noise with the conservation of biological signal."}

Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

Integrating RL modeling, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging during reversal learning, we discovered convergent RPE signatures - shared monoaminergic/synaptic gene upregulation and neuroanatomical representations, yet humans outperformed macaques behaviorally. Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity."}
