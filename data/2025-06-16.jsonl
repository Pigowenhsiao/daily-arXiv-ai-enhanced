This requires that the models are practically\nidentifiable, that is, the values of the parameters can be confidently\ndetermined, given available data. A well-designed experiment can produce data\nthat are much more informative for the purpose of inferring parameter values\nthan a poorly designed experiment. It is, therefore, of great interest to\noptimally design experiments such that the resulting data maximise the\npractical identifiability of a chosen model. Experimental design is also useful\nfor model discrimination, where we seek to distinguish between multiple\ndistinct, competing models of the same biological system in order to determine\nwhich model better reveals insight into the underlying biological mechanisms.\nIn many cases, an external stimulus can be used as a control input to probe the\nbehaviour of the system. In this paper, we will explore techniques for\noptimally designing such a control for a given experiment, in order to maximise\nparameter identifiability and model discrimination, and demonstrate these\ntechniques in the context of commonly applied ordinary differential equation\nmodels. We use a profile likelihood-based approach to assess parameter\nidentifiability.

Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep\nlearning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a\nhybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The\nmodel begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial\ndependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,\nand concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal\nregions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass\nfiltering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a\ncomprehensive preprocessing pipeline.

To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network,\na single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show\nnumerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a\nself-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit\ncycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then\nformulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in\nterms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an\nexplicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of\nmapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is\nshown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not\ndestabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in\ngeneral between the systems.

We calculated the differences in coherence and temporal delay\nbetween spontaneous peak electrophysiological activity and hemodynamic\nresponses across groups during the resting state in the prefrontal cortex\n(PFC). We found that the neural activity and its subsequent correlation with\nhemodynamic responses were significantly higher in patients during the\nmaintenance phase. The rise time from the lowest to the highest point of\ncorrelation was shorter in healthy individuals than in patients in the acute\nphase, and gradually recovered during remission. By leveraging wearable\nneuroimaging techniques, this study reveals alterations in neurovascular\ncoupling in depression and offers novel multimodal insights into potential\nbiomarkers for MDD and its recovery process."}

Yet, most\nviral genes remain uncharacterized, comprising what is commonly referred to as\n\"viral dark matter.\" Metagenomic studies across diverse environments\nconsistently show that 40-90% of viral genes lack known homologs or annotated\nfunctions. This persistent knowledge gap limits our ability to interpret viral\nsequence data, understand virus-host interactions, and assess the ecological or\napplied significance of viral genes. Among the most intriguing components of\nviral dark matter are auxiliary viral genes (AVGs), including auxiliary\nmetabolic genes (AMGs), regulatory genes (AReGs), and host physiology-modifying\ngenes (APGs), which may alter host function during infection and contribute to\nmicrobial metabolism, stress tolerance, or resistance. In this review, we\nexplore recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of\nviral dark matter. We highlight representative examples of novel viral proteins\nacross diverse ecosystems including human microbiomes, soil, oceans, and\nextreme environments, and discuss what is known, and still unknown, about their\nroles. We then examine the bioinformatic and experimental challenges that\nhinder functional characterization, and present emerging strategies to overcome\nthese barriers. Finally, we highlight both the fundamental and applied benefits\nthat multidisciplinary efforts to characterize viral proteins can bring. By\nintegrating computational predictions with experimental validation, and\nfostering collaboration across disciplines, we emphasize that illuminating\nviral dark matter is both feasible and essential for advancing microbial\necology and unlocking new tools for biotechnology."}

Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,\nthis paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based\npedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --\nsystems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We\nreview how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,\nerror correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural\nencoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning\nphenomena such as \"grokking\" and the neuroscience of overlearning and\nintuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI\nduring learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that\neffective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological\n\"schemata\" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and\nguide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and\nworkforce training in the age of large language models."}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window\ninto neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature\nposes significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep\nlearning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a\nhybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The\nmodel begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial\ndependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,\nand concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal\nregions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass\nfiltering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a\ncomprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM\nbaselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation\naccuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for\nintegration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized\nhealthcare systems."}

To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network,\na single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show\nnumerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a\nself-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit\ncycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then\nformulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in\nterms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an\nexplicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of\nmapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is\nshown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not\ndestabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in\ngeneral between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed\nas the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of\nsolutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature\naccurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a\nsolitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size."}

When the CPG undergoes periodic oscillations,\ncreated by Hopf bifurcation or other mechanisms, it can then transmit periodic\nsignals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or\nphase-synchronous manner. We proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nstability of these lifted periodic orbits, in several senses. Here we examine\nthe implications of the resulting theory for chains of neurons, using several\nstandard neuron models: FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar, Hindmarsh-Rose, and\nHodgkin-Huxley. We compare different notions of transverse stability, and\nsummarize some numerical simulations showing that for all these neuron models\nthe propagating signal can be transversely Floquet stable. Finally we discuss\nimplications for less idealized models."}
