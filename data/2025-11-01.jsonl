For example, Markov models for ion\nchannels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for \"slow\"\nand \"fast\" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool\nin the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing\nmodel states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,\neach individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct\nbiophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models\nand discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the\naggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using\nP\\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states\nthat exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.\nWe will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate\nnon-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable\nfully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of\nnon-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels.

Both properties influence the stability and\ndynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings\nremain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting\nBoolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given\ncanalizing properties.

This\nstudy conducts a comparative analysis of Stochastic Continuous-Time Markov\nChain (CTMC) and deterministic models to gain insights into rabies persistence\nwithin human and canine populations. By employing a multitype branching\nprocess, the stochastic threshold for rabies persistence was determined,\nrevealing important insights into how stochasticity influences extinction\nprobabilities. The stochastic model utilized 10,000 sample paths to estimate\nthe probabilities of rabies outbreaks, offering a rigorous assessment of the\nvariability in disease occurrences. Additionally, the study introduces a novel\nmathematical formulation of rabies transmission dynamics, which includes\nenvironmental reservoirs, free-ranging dogs, and domestic dogs as essential\ntransmission factors. The basic reproduction number ($\\mathcal{R}_0$) was\nderived and analyzed within stochastic frameworks, effectively bridging the gap\nbetween these two modeling approaches. Numerical simulations confirmed that the\nresults from the stochastic model closely aligned with those from the\ndeterministic model, while also highlighting the importance of stochasticity in\nscenarios with low infection rates.

The sequencing of\nmirror-image peptides relies on \\textit{de-novo} technology. However, its\naccuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and\nthe challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides\ndirectly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy\nindirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this\nwork, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates\nsequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry\nenvironmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.\nIn this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are\neasy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as\nfollows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset\ncontaining 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond\ncleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million\nlabeled data based on MiPD513.

We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that\naddresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),\nallowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar\nbrain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All\nmodel components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient\ntraining with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT\npredicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level\nsemantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic\ncontent of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to\ninitialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.\nBIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to\nlocalized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image\nreconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and\nsurpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective\nmetrics.
