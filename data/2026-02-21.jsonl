While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis."}

Molecular chronologies are series of time events describing the history of biological systems and subsystems and the rise of biological innovations. Together with time-varying networks, these chronologies provide a window into the past. Areas covered: Here, we review molecular chronologies and networks built with modern methods of phylogeny reconstruction. We discuss how chronologies of structural domain families uncover the explosive emergence of metabolism, the late rise of translation, the co-evolution of ribosomal proteins and rRNA, and the late development of the ribosomal exit tunnel; events that coincided with a tendency to shorten folding time. Evolving networks described the early emergence of domains and a late big bang of domain combinations. Expert opinion: Two processes, folding and recruitment appear central to the evolutionary progression. The former increases protein persistence. The later fosters diversity. Chronologically, protein evolution mirrors folding by combining supersecondary structures into domains, developing translation machinery to facilitate folding speed and stability, and enhancing structural complexity by establishing long-distance interactions in novel structural and architectural designs."}

Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil"}

While assessing pathogen similarity through whole genome sequencing (WGS) is considered the gold standard for outbreak detection, its high cost and lengthy turnaround time preclude routine implementation in clinical laboratories. We explore the utility of two rapid and cost-effective alternatives to WGS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and antimicrobial resistance (AR) patterns. We develop a machine learning framework that extracts informative representations from MALDI-TOF spectra and AR patterns for outbreak detection and explore their fusion. Through multi-species analyses, we demonstrate that in some cases MALDI-TOF and AR have the potential to reduce reliance on WGS, enabling more accessible and rapid outbreak surveillance."}

Accurate edge-based diagnosis across geographically dispersed farms is crucial for recognising tomato diseases in sustainable farming. Traditional centralised training aggregates raw data on a central server, leading to communication overhead, privacy risks and latency. Meanwhile, edge devices require lightweight networks to operate effectively within limited resources. In this paper, we propose U-FedTomAtt, an ultra-lightweight federated learning framework with attention for tomato disease recognition in resource-constrained and distributed environments. The model comprises only 245.34K parameters and 71.41 MFLOPS. First, we propose an ultra-lightweight neural network with dilated bottleneck (DBNeck) modules and a linear transformer to minimise computational and memory overhead. To mitigate potential accuracy loss, a novel local-global residual attention (LoGRA) module is incorporated. Second, we propose the federated dual adaptive weight aggregation (FedDAWA) algorithm that enhances global model accuracy. Third, our framework is validated using three benchmark datasets for tomato diseases under simulated federated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 0.9910% and 0.9915% Top-1 accuracy and 0.9923% and 0.9897% F1-scores on SLIF-Tomato and PlantVillage tomato datasets, respectively."}

Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ANTS 2026: 15th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (to appear in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, LNCS)", "summary": "Designing systems for autonomous transport of groups of living agents has received a lot of attention in recent years due to a wealth of important potential applications. Biomimetic approaches are often sought, and a range of herding algorithms, inspired by how dogs herd sheep, as well as leadership algorithms mimicking leader-follower systems, have been introduced. However, they suffer from a common problem: shepherding algorithms require that agents evade the shepherd, and leading algorithms require that agents follow. This can cause problems in real-world applications where the behavioral responses of the agents to a transporter are likely to be heterogeneous over both long and short timescales. Here, we introduce an algorithm that adaptively switches between leading and herding depending on the response it receives from the agents to mitigate this problem. We show via simulation that this mixed algorithm can transport groups with any follower and evader composition, and we compare its performance with lead-only and herd-only algorithms. We also show that the mixed algorithm can deal with groups where individual agents randomly switch their strategy over time, as long as sufficient time is provided to complete the task relative to the switching rate. Given that our algorithm overcomes issues associated with herd-only and lead-only algorithms and might also, as a side effect, mitigate the issue of habituation to robotic transporters, it takes us one step closer to realizing many of the proposed applications for these types of algorithms."}

Detecting known resistance mutations directly from sequencing reads, in special metagenomic samples, remains a major challenge. As fungal pathogens are often neglected compared with bacterial pathogens, most available tools are designed for bacterial taxa, whereas tools targeting fungi typically require assembled genomes. In metagenomic datasets, assembly-based strategies may result in substantial information loss due to genome fragmentation, low-abundance species, or incomplete recovery of resistance loci. Results: Here, we present FUNGAR, an open-source pipeline for the rapid identification of antifungal resistance genes and mutations directly from short-read data. FUNGAR employs translated alignments with DIAMOND and curated data from the FungAMR database to detect amino acid substitutions across all six open reading frames. The pipeline produces structured, reproducible reports linking detected variants to their associated antifungal drugs and can be easily customized for new species or databases."}

Specialized laboratories such as biofoundries are advancing these processes using high-throughput bioreactor platforms, which generate vast datasets. However, the lack of community standards limits data accessibility and interoperability, preventing integration across platforms. In order to address this, we introduce PREFER, an open-source ontology designed to establish a unified standard for bioprocess data. Built in alignment with the widely adopted Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and connecting with several other community ontologies, PREFER ensures consistency and cross-domain compatibility and covers the whole precision fermentation process. Integrating PREFER into high-throughput bioprocess development workflows enables structured metadata that supports automated cross-platform execution and high-fidelity data capture. Furthermore, PREFER's standardization has the potential to bridge disparate data silos, generating machine-actionable datasets critical for training predictive, robust machine learning models in synthetic biology. This work provides the foundation for scalable, interoperable bioprocess systems and supports the transition toward more data-driven bioproduction."}

Applying this framework to scGPT and Geneformer, we find that attention patterns encode structured biological information with layer-specific organisation - protein-protein interactions in early layers, transcriptional regulation in late layers - but this structure provides no incremental value for perturbation prediction: trivial gene-level baselines outperform both attention and correlation edges (AUROC 0.81-0.88 versus 0.70), pairwise edge scores add zero predictive contribution, and causal ablation of regulatory heads produces no degradation. These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal. Cell-State Stratified Interpretability (CSSI) addresses an attention-specific scaling failure, improving GRN recovery up to 1.85x. The framework establishes reusable quality-control standards for the field."}

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence."}
