One motivation for considering this issue comes from the behavior of\nauditory neurons. These neurons reportedly have the ability to fire spikes in a\nprecise range of phases in response to incoming sound waves, a behavior for\nwhich the mechanism is unknown. To account for such a response precision, we\nintroduce the notion of dynamic threshold curve (DTC), which estimates at each\ntime the effective likelihood that noise will subsequently generate a spike.\nThe DTC effectively summarizes, in a single curve, a representation of the\nresponse precision of an excitable model, as we demonstrate by showing that the\ndistribution of spike times produced in this setting is well captured by the\nfirst passage time of a simple, Gaussian stochastic process to the distance to\nthe DTC. This result shows that peaks and troughs of the DTC, but also their\nslopes, convey fine information about spike timing in response to noise.
