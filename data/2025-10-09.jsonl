Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based\nmodel, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain\nimaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from\nMIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was\nperformed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by\nfine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2)\nNeu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT\nwith MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness.

Results: The\nNeu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant\nimprovements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain\nabnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries.\nLlama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary\nclassification accuracy.

We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common\npool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We\nintroduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and\nfailure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it\nis possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The\nframework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as\nwell as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19.

However, as a\ncorrelation-based approach, FC captures the co-fluctuation between brain\nregions rather than the intensity of neural activity in each region.\nConsequently, FC provides only a partial view of functional variability, and\nthis limitation is particularly pronounced in WM, where functional signals are\nweaker and more susceptible to noise. To tackle this limitation, we introduce\nfractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to measure the\nintensity of spontaneous neural activity and analyze functional variability in\nWM. Specifically, we propose a novel method to quantify WM functional\nvariability by estimating the differential identifiability of fALFF. Higher\ndifferential identifiability is observed in WM fALFF compared to FC, which\nindicates that fALFF is more sensitive to WM functional variability. Through\nfALFF differential identifiability, we evaluate the functional variabilities of\nboth WM and GM, and find the overall functional variability pattern is similar\nalthough WM shows slightly lower variability than GM. The regional functional\nvariabilities of WM are associated with structural connectivity, where\ncommissural fiber regions generally exhibit higher variability than projection\nfiber regions. Furthermore, we discover that WM functional variability\ndemonstrates a spatial gradient ascending from the brainstem to the cortex by\nhypothesis testing, which aligns well with the evolutionary expansion. The\ngradient of functional variability in WM provides novel insights for\nunderstanding WM function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nattempt to investigate WM functional variability via fALFF."}

In subsequent years a\nhost of new methods was introduced that measured both the synchrony among\nneuronal spike trains and the directional component, e.g. how activity\npropogates between neurons. This development culminated with a new class of\nmeasures that are both time scale independent and time resolved. These include\nthe two spike train distances ISI- and SPIKE-Distance as well as the\ncoincidence detector SPIKE-Synchronization and its directional companion\nSPIKE-Order. This article will not only review all of these measures but also\ninclude two recently proposed algorithms for latency correction which build on\nSPIKE-order and aim to optimize the spike time alignment of sparse spike trains\nwith well-defined global spiking events. For the sake of clarity, all these\nmethods will be illustrated on artificially generated data but in each case\nexemplary applications to real neuronal data will be described as well."}
