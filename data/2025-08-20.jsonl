Existing modeling\nparadigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor\nregulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network\nstructure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the\nProbabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical\napproach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.\nFirstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and\ncomposition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)\nserve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic\ncellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as\nprobability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end\ngenerative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior\ndistribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is\nachieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample\nnetwork topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to\npredict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework\nprovides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and\nuncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and\nsystems-level analysis."}

Here, we introduce VIBES, a\nmulti-scale modeling framework that explicitly integrates viral dynamics based\non patient-level data with population-level transmission on a data-driven\nnetwork of social contacts. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we analyze three\nemergent epidemic properties, namely the generation time, serial interval, and\npre-symptomatic transmission. First, we established a purely biological\nbaseline, thus independent of the reproduction number (R), from the within-host\nmodel, estimating a generation time of 6.3 days for symptomatic individuals and\n43.1% presymptomatic transmission. Then, using the full model incorporating\nsocial contacts, we found a shorter generation time (5.4 days at R=3.0) and an\nincrease in pre-symptomatic transmission (52.8% at R=3.0), disentangling the\nimpact of social drivers from a purely biological baseline. We further show\nthat as pathogen transmissibility increases (R from 1.3 to 6), competition\namong infectious individuals shortens the generation time and serial interval\nby up to 21% and 13%, respectively. Conversely, a social intervention, like\nisolation, increases the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission by about\n30%. Our framework also estimates metrics that are challenging to obtain\nempirically, such as the generation time for asymptomatic individuals (5.6\ndays; 95%CI: 5.1-6.0 at R=1.3). Our findings establish multi-scale modeling as\na powerful tool for mechanistically quantifying how pathogen biology and human\nsocial behavior shape epidemic dynamics as well as for assessing public health\ninterventions."}

In particular, because of the\naction of natural selection, we can often learn something about an environment\nby examining local organisms, and vice versa. For example, the characteristics\nof a cactus suggest that the local environment is relatively dry, and if a\nnatural terrestrial environment is dry, then we will generally have an enhanced\nprobability of finding drought-resistant plants (like cacti). Here, we propose\na measure that can be used to quantify the information that is created by\nnatural selection. We call the proposed quantity reproductive information, and\nwe show that it has an intuitively satisfying relationship to standard\nquantitative definitions of information. Reproductive information is also\napproximately equal to a previously defined measure of biological adaptation.\nIn addition, we explain how reproductive information can be measured using\nphenotypic characters, instead of genotypes. This could facilitate the\nmeasurement of reproductive information, and it could also allow for the\nquantification of the information that is created by natural selection on\ngroups of organisms, instead of just selection on individuals. Thus, the\nconcept of reproductive information has the potential to advance research on\nthe \"units of selection\", the \"major transitions in evolution\", and the\nemergence of \"superorganisms\" via cooperation among group members."}

Accurate neuron localization\nimproves spike sorting, which involves detecting action potentials and\nassigning them to individual neurons. It also helps monitor probe drift, which\naffects long-term probe reliability. Although several localization algorithms\nare currently in use, the field is nascent and arguments for using one\nalgorithm over another are largely theoretical or based on visual analysis of\nclustering results. We present a first-of-its-kind benchmarking of commonly\nused neuron localization algorithms. We tested these algorithms using two\nground truth datasets: a biophysically realistic simulated dataset, and\nexperimental data combining patch-clamp and Neuropixels probes. We\nsystematically evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and runtime of these\nalgorithms in ideal conditions and long-term recording conditions with\nelectrode decay. Our findings highlight significant performance differences;\nwhile more complex and physically realistic models perform better in ideal\nsituations, simple heuristics demonstrate superior robustness to noise and\nelectrode degradation in experimental datasets, making them more suitable for\nlong-term neural recordings. This work provides a framework for assessing\nlocalization algorithms and developing robust, biologically grounded algorithms\nto advance the development of brain-machine interfaces."}

In this exploratory analysis we reanalyze a public\nEEG dataset of musicians listening to or imagining music (Bach chorales) while\nsimultaneously reading from a sheet of music. We ask whether blink timing in\nreading music, accompanied by listening or imagery, is sufficient to uniquely\nidentify the music being read from a given score. Intra-subject blink counts\nand timing are compared across trials using a spike train distance metric\n(Victor and Purpura, 1997). One-trial-left-out cross-validation is used to\nidentify the music being read with above chance level accuracy (best subject:\n56\\%, chance: 25\\%), where accuracy is seen to vary with subject, condition,\nand a tunable cost factor for time shifts. Future studies may consider\nincorporating eye blink contributions to brain decoding, especially in\nwearables where eye blinks could be easier to record than EEG given their\nhigher amplitudes."}

Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by\nrandomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a\nprobabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a\nparadigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population\nimpinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of\nintegrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent\nplasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We\nfirst analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single\nsynapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump\nprocess to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging\nnew analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations\nbetween pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations\nseen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this\nmicrodynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations\nare trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses\nconnecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By\nmapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the\nsingle-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural\nand synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation\nand the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case\nof sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which\nare strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are\nignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our\nframework can be extended."}
