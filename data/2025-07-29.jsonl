Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological\nstructure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for\nessentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this\nhypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a\nreaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic\nfeatures, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to\ndescribe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was\ntrained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked\nagainst a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated\nground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid\npredictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall:\n0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to\ncorrectly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score\nof 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a \"structure-first\" machine\nlearning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene\nessentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By\nlearning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model\nsuccessfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in\nhandling biological redundancy.

In this regard, the study of the main patterns of thrombus formation\nduring ELT and modelling of endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is\nrelevant. Based on the assumption of diffusion limiting of biochemical\nprocesses occurring during the coagulation of blood, by recalculating the\nreaction rates according to the Stokes-Einstein equation, a simple point model\nof blood coagulation during ELT was built in this paper. As a result of the use\nof this model, it was demonstrated that blood heating entails an increase in\nthe rate of thrombin production, a decrease in the time for achieving the peak\nof its concentration by 5-6 times with its almost constant amplitude. Heating\nleads to the rapid formation of fibrin clusters and the appearance of a\nfibrin-polymer network with a smaller cell size. The quantitative dependence on\nthe selected rheological model was also shown. All the data necessary for using\nthe model are given in this article for reproducibility."}

This study evaluated muscle\nsynergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination\nin lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational\ncyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer.\nElectromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and\nmuscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The\nCoactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index\n(SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle\nsynergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in\nsynergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular\ndemands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at\nthe knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a\ngreater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those\nof the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution\nof hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power\nlevels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting\na reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular\ncoordination.
