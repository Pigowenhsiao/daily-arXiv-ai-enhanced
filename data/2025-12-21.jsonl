We present a method based on a neural extension of compressed sensing to function space. We measure the activity of multiple different molecules simultaneously, rather than individually. Then, we deconvolute the molecule-activity map during model training. Co-design of wet lab experiments and learning algorithms provably leads to orders-of-magnitude gains in information density. We demonstrate on antibodies and cell therapies."}

Sejnowski"], "title": "Dynamical Mechanisms for Coordinating Long-term Working Memory Based on the Precision of Spike-timing in Cortical Neurons", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "26 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of the millisecond precision of spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could, in principle, preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. It could support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are synchronously stimulated. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025)."}

We present an open-source algorithm, published as a Python package, to automatically extract parametric bounds from color fundus images, and for applying contrast enhancement. The software has applications in automated biomarker calculation and AI systems. Bounds detection was implemented by detecting the CFI's contour via a shortest path algorithm on a polar transformation of the image. A second step detects points along the CFI circle robustly via a circle-fitting RANSAC algorithm. Straight boundaries are detected independently. Finally, the CFI is mirrored along its bounds before contrast enhancement to eliminate edge artifacts. We manually evaluated correctness on the EyeQ and Rotterdam Study datasets. Evaluation on the EyeQ CFI quality dataset revealed an error rate of 0.2% for our method, compared to 1.9% for previous work. On a sample of challenging CFI images from the Rotterdam Study, our method did not produce any mistakes. retinalysis-fundusprep is an improvement over existing publicly available code for CFI bounds detection. The improved reliability may allow for its use on a wider range of datasets without the need for manual validation."}

These models are designed to move beyond narrow pattern recognition towards emulating sophisticated clinical reasoning, understanding complex spatial relationships, and integrating multimodal data with unprecedented flexibility. However, a critical gap exists between this potential and the current reality, where the clinical evaluation and deployment of FMs are hampered by significant challenges. Herein, we critically assess the current state-of-the-art, analyzing hype by examining the core capabilities and limitations of FMs in the biomedical domain. We also provide a taxonomy of reasoning, ranging from emulated sequential logic and spatial understanding to the integration of explicit symbolic knowledge, to evaluate whether these models exhibit genuine cognition or merely mimic surface-level patterns. We argue that a critical frontier lies beyond statistical correlation, in the pursuit of causal inference, which is essential for building robust models that understand cause and effect. Furthermore, we discuss the paramount issues in deployment stemming from trustworthiness, bias, and safety, dissecting the challenges of algorithmic bias, data bias and privacy, and model hallucinations. We also draw attention to the need for more inclusive, rigorous, and clinically relevant validation frameworks to ensure their safe and ethical application. We conclude that while the vision of autonomous AI-doctors remains distant, the immediate reality is the emergence of powerful technology and assistive tools that would benefit clinical practice. The future of FMs in biomedical imaging hinges not on scale alone, but on developing hybrid, causally aware, and verifiably safe systems that augment, rather than replace, human expertise."}

Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest echo to fruitful thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator, or the cogito."}

The $θNK$ model introduces a parameter $θ$ to integrate local Rough Mount Fuji-type correlations in subgenotype contributions, simulating more biologically realistic correlated fitness effects. The $HNK$ model incorporates gene regulation effects by introducing a masking mechanism where certain loci modulate the expression of other loci, simulating effects observed in gene regulatory networks without modeling the full network. Through extensive simulations across a wide range of parameters ($N$, $K$, $θ$, and $H$), we analyze the impact of these modifications on landscape accessibility and the number of local optima. We find that increasing $θ$ or the number of masking loci ($H$) generally enhances accessibility, even in landscapes with many local optima, showing that ruggedness doesn't necessarily hinder evolutionary pathways. Additionally, distinct interaction patterns (blocked, adjacent, random) lead to different observations in accessibility and optimum structure. While more complex than traditional $NK$, we believe each model provides a new biologically relevant facet to fitness landscapes and provides insight into how genetic and regulatory structures influence the evolutionary potential of populations."}

Here, we introduce a framework to leverage week-long intracranial and audio recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, effectively increasing the training dataset size by over two orders of magnitude. With this pretraining, our contrastive learning model substantially outperforms models trained solely on classic experimental data, with gains that scale log-linearly with dataset size. Analysis of the learned representations reveals that, while brain activity represents speech features, its global structure largely drifts across days, highlighting the need for models that explicitly account for cross-day variability. Overall, our approach opens a scalable path toward decoding and modeling brain representations in both real-life and controlled task settings."}

Class imbalance in skin lesion datasets, notably the defects in the representation of malignant(cancerous) cases, is one of the difficulties for deep learning models' performances and generalizations. This paper offers an exhaustive review of some of the balancing methods that aim to address class imbalances using the example of the ISIC 2016 dataset. A light-weight CNN model, MobileNetV2, was combined with under-sampling, over-sampling, and hybrid balancing methods such as Tomek Links(TL), SMOTE, and SMOTE with TL. Over-sampling methods like SMOTE and ADASYN improve performance but may lead to overfitting due to redundant synthetic samples. Hybrid methods like SMOTE+TL counter this drawback by removing noisy or boundary samples so that model generalization is enhanced. Thus, this analysis stresses the need to choose the right balancing methods for robust and sensitive diagnostic systems in medical image processing."}

Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability?

Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning."}

While recent computational advances, such as diffusion models, can design high-affinity IDP binders, translating these to practical drug discovery requires autonomous systems capable of reasoning across complex conformational ensembles and orchestrating diverse computational tools at scale.To address this challenge, we designed and implemented StructBioReasoner, a scalable multi-agent system for designing biologics that can be used to target IDPs. StructBioReasoner employs a novel tournament-based reasoning framework where specialized agents compete to generate and refine therapeutic hypotheses, naturally distributing computational load for efficient exploration of the vast design space. Agents integrate domain knowledge with access to literature synthesis, AI-structure prediction, molecular simulations, and stability analysis, coordinating their execution on HPC infrastructure via an extensible federated agentic middleware, Academy. We benchmark StructBioReasoner across Der f 21 and NMNAT-2 and demonstrate that over 50\\% of 787 designed and validated candidates for Der f 21 outperformed the human-designed reference binders from literature, in terms of improved binding free energy. For the more challenging NMNAT-2 protein, we identified three binding modes from 97,066 binders, including the well-studied NMNAT2:p53 interface. Thus, StructBioReasoner lays the groundwork for agentic reasoning systems for IDP therapeutic discovery on Exascale platforms."}

MgO HNTs were synthesized through an electrodeposition process and characterized by scanning electron microscopy to confirm successful surface modification. Growth experiments using Heirloom Cherry Tomato and Golden Tomato seeds were conducted under hydroponic and soil based conditions and subsequently extended to lunar and Martian regolith simulants. A response surface methodology approach based on a Box Behnken design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature, MgO HNT concentration, and light duration on multiple growth responses. Seedling length and the root length stress tolerance index were identified as the most responsive indicators of MgO HNT treatment. Optimal conditions consisting of 25 C, 12 h light exposure, and 100 mg per L MgO HNTs produced the greatest increases in root and shoot length in Earth soil simulants. Validation experiments in extraterrestrial regolith analogs showed that MgO HNTs supported germination, root penetration, and overall seedling vigor under nutrient limited and high stress conditions. Lunar regolith exhibited maximal root development at 100 mg per L, whereas Martian regolith showed optimal growth at 10 mg per L, reflecting differences in mineral composition and oxidative characteristics. These findings demonstrate that MgO HNTs can enhance early plant development across both terrestrial and extraterrestrial substrates and support their potential use as nanomaterial based amendments for sustainable plant cultivation in Earth and space environments."}
