However, recent studies show some DDXs can also unwind dsRNA without ATP, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Here, we developed HelixTriad coarse-grained RNA model, incorporating Watson-Crick base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics within a three-bead-per-nucleotide scheme to accurately reproduce experimental RNA melting curves. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak, specific DDX3X-dsRNA interactions drive stochastic strand separation without ATP. Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions. Together, our findings suggest that ATP-independent dsRNA unwinding by DDXs is predominantly entropy-driven, offering new mechanistic insights into RNA helicases versatility."}

Efficiently identifying specific enzymes from vast protein libraries is essential for advancing biocatalysis. Traditional computational methods for enzyme screening and retrieval are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods focus solely on the interaction between enzymes and reactions, overlooking the inherent hierarchical relationships within each domain. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. FGW-CLIP incorporates multiple alignments, including inter-domain alignment between reactions and enzymes and intra-domain alignment within enzymes and reactions. By introducing a tailored regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, which enhances information integration across these domains. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of FGW-CLIP in challenging enzyme-reaction tasks. On the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, FGW-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme virtual screening, as measured by BEDROC and EF metrics. Moreover, FGW-CLIP consistently outperforms across all three splits of ReactZyme, the largest enzyme-reaction benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization to novel enzymes and reactions. These results position FGW-CLIP as a promising framework for enzyme discovery in complex biochemical settings, with strong adaptability across diverse screening scenarios."}

We focus on a model in which the feedback from cell size to these other processes occurs only through the size deviations, defined as the difference between the absolute size and the progression through the cell cycle. In a linear regime of this model, the dynamics reduce to a stochastically forced simple harmonic oscillator, yielding closed-form expressions for mother-daughter size correlations. We compare these to the higher order regression coefficients that measure the size memory over many generations. Our analysis reveals how the interplay between cell-cycle timing and intrinsic fluctuations shapes the apparent coarse-grained size control strategy, and in-particular, that coarse-grained correlations may not reflect the mechanistic feedback structure. We compare this model to a more commonly used approach where the coarse-grained dynamics are hard-coded into the model; hence, the first order autoregressive model for sizes is a perfect description of the size dynamics and therefore more accurately reflects the feedback structure."}

However, the design of these vaccines requires sophisticated computational workflows to predict and prioritize neoantigen candidates from patient sequencing data, coupled with rigorous review to ensure candidate quality. While numerous computational tools exist for neoantigen prediction, to our knowledge, there are no established protocols detailing the complete process from raw sequencing data through systematic candidate selection. Here, we present ImmunoNX (Immunogenomics Neoantigen eXplorer), an end-to-end protocol for neoantigen prediction and vaccine design that has supported over 185 patients across 11 clinical trials. The workflow integrates tumor DNA/RNA and matched normal DNA sequencing data through a computational pipeline built with Workflow Definition Language (WDL) and executed via Cromwell on Google Cloud Platform. ImmunoNX employs consensus-based variant calling, in-silico HLA typing, and pVACtools for neoantigen prediction. Additionally, we describe a two-stage immunogenomics review process with prioritization of neoantigen candidates, enabled by pVACview, followed by manual assessment of variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). This workflow enables vaccine design in under three months. We demonstrate the protocol using the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line dataset, identifying 78 high-confidence neoantigen candidates from 322 initial predictions. Although demonstrated here for vaccine development, this workflow can be adapted for diverse neoantigen therapies and experiments. Therefore, this protocol provides the research community with a reproducible, version-controlled framework for designing personalized neoantigen vaccines, supported by detailed documentation, example datasets, and open-source code."}

Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns; while the readout module achieves biological fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, we present this work as a study of the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns."}

These strategies may require trade-offs to be made between the health impact of the pandemic and the economic costs of the interventions introduced in response. Mathematical models are a useful tool that can help understand the consequences of alternative policy options on the future dynamics and impact of the epidemic. Most models have focused on direct health impacts, neglecting the economic costs of control measures. Here, we introduce a model framework that captures both health and economic costs. We use this framework to compare the expected aggregate costs of mitigation, suppression and elimination strategies, across a range of different epidemiological and economic parameters. We find that for diseases with low severity, mitigation tends to be the most cost-effective option. For more severe diseases, suppression tends to be most cost effective if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is relatively low, while elimination tends to be more cost-effective if $R_0$ is high. We use the example of New Zealand's elimination response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 to anchor our framework to a real-world case study. We find that parameter estimates for Covid-19 in New Zealand put it close to or above the threshold at which elimination becomes more cost-effective than mitigation. We conclude that our proposed framework holds promise as a decision-support tool for future pandemic threats, although further work is needed to account for population heterogeneity and other factors relevant to decision-making."}

We analyze how decaying and accelerating mutation rates shape the saturation and propagation of population fronts through level-set geometry.

Paper presented at the 5th International Conference on AI and Machine Learning, London, November 2025", "summary": "Neurons, as eukaryotic cells, have powerful internal computation capabilities. One neuron can have many distinct states, and brains can use this capability. Processes of neuron growth and maintenance use chemical signalling between cell bodies and synapses, ferrying chemical messengers over microtubules and actin fibres within cells. These processes are computations which, while slower than neural electrical signalling, could allow any neuron to change its state over intervals of seconds or minutes. Based on its state, a single neuron can selectively de-activate some of its synapses, sculpting a dynamic neural net from the static neural connections of the brain. Without this dynamic selection, the static neural networks in brains are too amorphous and dilute to do the computations of neural cognitive models. The use of multi-state neurons in animal brains is illustrated in hierarchical Bayesian object recognition. Multi-state neurons may support a design which is more efficient than two-state neurons, and scales better as object complexity increases. Brains could have evolved to use multi-state neurons. Multi-state neurons could be used in artificial neural networks, to use a kind of non-Hebbian learning which is faster and more focused and controllable than traditional neural net learning. This possibility has not yet been explored in computational models."}

Methods: Using CD103/CD8-immunostained colorectal cancer WSIs and publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, spatial gene fields were constructed around mapped cells and discretized for signed phi-mixing computation. Pairwise dependencies, directional signs, and triplet structures were evaluated through kNN-based neighborhood screening and bootstrap consensus inference. Mediation and convergence were distinguished using generalized additive models (GAMs), with spatial validity assessed by real-null comparisons and database-backed direction checks. Results: Across tissue patches, the pipeline reduced approximately 3.6x10^4 triplet candidates to a reproducible consensus set (approximately 3x10^2 per patch). The downstream edge (Y to Z) showed significant directional bias consistent with curated regulatory databases. Spatial path tracing demonstrated markedly higher coherence for real triplets than for null controls, indicating that inferred chains represent biologically instantiated regulatory flows.

We introduce a model that couples active agents with a dynamic environment, interpreted as a nutrient source. Agents are persistent random walkers that gather food from the environment and store it in an inner energy depot. This energy is used for self-propulsion, metabolic expenses, and reproduction. The environment is a two-dimensional surface divided into patches, each of them producing food. Thus, population size and resource distribution become emergent properties of the system. Combining simulations and analytical framework to analyze limiting cases, we show that the system exhibits distinct phases separating quasi-static and highly motile regimes. We observe that, in general, population sizes are inversely proportional to the average energy per agent. Furthermore, we find that, counter-intuitively, reduced access to resources or increased metabolic expenditure can lead to a larger population size.

To achieve this goal, we first show that the asymptotic expression for the fixation probability in the Moran process, when the population size is large and individual interaction is almost arbitrary (including cases modeled through $d$-player game theory), is a convex combination of the asymptotic approximations obtained in the constant fitness case or 2-player game theory. We discuss several examples and the inverse problem, i.e., how to derive a Moran process that is compatible with a given replicator dynamics. In particular, we prove that modeling a Moran process with an inner metastable state may require the use of $d$-player game theory with possibly large $d$ values, depending on the precise location of the inner equilibrium."}

Spatial dissemination of vector-borne disease is strongly shaped by the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, creating substantial overlap between vector activity and pathogen spread. We developed a mathematical model for Culex mosquito dynamics in a patchy landscape, integrating entomological observations, weather-driven factors, and the vector control practices of the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD) in Cook County, Illinois. By coupling a temperature-driven multi-patch ODE model with NWMAD's adulticide and larvicide interventions, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and control timing influence mosquito abundance. We also evaluated how mosquito dispersal modifies intervention effectiveness by comparing single-patch and two-patch model outcomes. Our results showed that models ignoring spatial connectivity can substantially overestimate the impact of interventions or misidentify the thresholds of vector persistence. Through numerical simulations, we analysed continuous and pulsatile control approaches under varying spatial and temporal configurations. These findings provide insight into optimal strategies for managing Culex populations and mitigating mosquito-borne disease risk in weather-driven, spatially connected environments across Cook County, Illinois."}

Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience."}
