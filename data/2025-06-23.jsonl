The CDC\nincorporates additional well-established steps, including protein folding and\nprotein networking, highlighting the cyclical nature of information flow in\ncells. This cyclic architecture is proposed as a key mechanism for cellular\nmemory, drawing analogies to memory functions in computers, such as input,\nread, write, execute, and erase. The interconnected cycles within the CDCN,\nincluding metabolic cycles and signaling pathways, are suggested to function\nakin to latches in computer memory, contributing to the storage and processing\nof cellular information beyond nucleic acid sequences.

The history of extant\ngenetic material is usually modeled backwards in time, but tracking chromosomes\nat a large scale is not trivial, as successive recombination events break them\ninto several segments. For this reason, the behavior of the distribution of\ngenetic segments across the ancestral population is not fully understood.\nMoreover, as individuals transmit only half of their genetic content to their\noffspring, after a few generations, it is possible that ghosts arise, that is,\ngenealogical ancestors that transmit no genetic material to any individual.\n  While several theoretical predictions exist to estimate properties of\nancestral segments or ghosts, most of them rely on simplifying assumptions such\nas an infinite population size or an infinite chromosome length. It is not\nclear how well these results hold in a finite universe, and current simulators\neither make other approximations or cannot handle the scale required to answer\nthese questions. In this work, we use an exact back-in-time simulator of large\ndiploid populations experiencing recombination that tracks genealogical and\ngenetic ancestry, without approximations. We focus on the distinction between\ngenealogical and genetic ancestry and, additionally, we explore the effects of\ngenome structure on ancestral segment distribution and the proportion of\ngenetic ancestors.

This paper expands\nupon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account\nfor the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the\nBayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the\nsignatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external\ninformation, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This\nmodel converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with\nindependent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and\nresults in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In\naddition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure\nof the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving\nthe algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the\ndependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of\nbiological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer.\nThe code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package.\nOur work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency\nstructure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable\nto any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational\nsignatures."}

However, it is\ntime-intensive because of manual data review, limited automation, and\ndifficulties in adapting algorithms across sources. Since LLMs have\ndemonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and\ngeneration, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks\ntraditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation\ncomputational phenotyping methods, we developed SHREC, a framework for\ncomprehensive integration of LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines.\nMaterials and Methods: We applied and tested the ability of three lightweight\nLLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to\nclassify concepts and phenotype patients using previously developed phenotypes\nfor ARF respiratory support therapies. Results: All models performed well on\nconcept classification, with the best model (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of\n0.896 across all relevant concepts. For phenotyping, models demonstrated\nnear-perfect specificity for all phenotypes, and the top-performing model\n(Mistral) reached an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes,\ndespite lower performance on multi-therapy phenotypes. Discussion: There are\nseveral advantages of LLMs that support their application to computational\nphenotyping, such as their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt\nengineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps\nto advance next-generation phenotyping methods include determining optimal\nstrategies for integrating biomedical data, exploring how LLMs reason, and\nadvancing generative model methods. Conclusion: Current lightweight LLMs can\nfeasibly assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks such as\nmanual data review."}

Here, we propose an alternative to\ntraditional deterministic regulation. We theoretically demonstrate that\nstochastic martingale turnover, in which cells proliferate through mutual\ncompetition and decay without component-specific control, naturally converges\nto an appropriate population balance characterized by a low probability of cell\nloss. This compositional change is described by a modified Langevin equation,\nwhere conserved mass is replaced by a dynamic variable representing the fitness\nof the current composition. A random walk model with step lengths that shorten\nnear the target, together with its mathematical solution, demonstrates entropy\nincrease under favorable conditions. Thus, we propose a fundamental principle\nfor autonomous biological control."}

In this study, we present a novel framework that models\nthe sequence landscape as a hypercube $H(k,2)$ and integrates wavelet-based\nsignal denoising with a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict\nprotein fitness across rugged fitness landscapes. Using a dataset of 419\nexperimentally measured mutant sequences of the Tobacco 5-Epi-Aristolochene\nSynthase (TEAS) enzyme, we preprocess the fitness signals using a 1-D discrete\nwavelet transform with a Daubechies-3 basis to suppress experimental noise\nwhile preserving local epistatic patterns. Our model comprises two GCN layers,\nallowing for beyond pairwise aggregation, followed by a multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP). We show that our approach, EHCube4P, generalizes well across different\nenzyme activity datasets and effectively captures higher-order mutational\ninteractions. Performance varies with the ruggedness of the fitness landscape,\nwith smoother signals yielding higher test set $r^2$ scores. These results\ndemonstrate that combining wavelet preprocessing with graph-based deep learning\nenhances the robustness and generalization of fitness prediction, particularly\nfor sparse and noisy biological datasets. The approach provides a scalable and\ninterpretable framework for protein fitness estimation applicable to a broad\nrange of combinatorial biological systems."}

Strobl"], "title": "Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-bio.QM", "stat.ML"], "comment": "R code is available at github.com/ericstrobl/DEBIAS", "summary": "Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,\nespecially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding\nfrequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment\neffect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding\nthrough observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of\nunconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this\nfoundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to\nmaximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with\nBackdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,\nclinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable\ntreatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent\nconfounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments\nin psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically\nverifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically\ninterpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression\nand schizophrenia."}
