Traditional\nmodels for homogeneous soft tissues under uniaxial loading predict higher\nstretch and stress in thinner regions. In fact, large gradients in stretch and\nstress are predicted to be induced by spatial variations in wall thickness. In\nprior studies, the role of collagen fibers in regions of thickness transition\nhas been largely neglected or only considered in terms of their effect on\nanisotropy. Here, we explore the role of collagen fibers as primary\nload-bearing components across regions of varying wall thickness, using a\nthree-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model incorporating\nexplicit collagen fiber architecture and a gradual thickness gradient. We\nexamined two distinct collagen fiber configurations across the thickness\ntransition: one featuring abrupt fiber termination and another with fiber\ncontinuity. Finite element analysis (FEA) under uniaxial tension revealed that\nload transfer by continuous fibers across the specimen markedly reduced the\nimportance of the change in wall thickness, with stretch differentials dropping\nfrom ~20% (fiber-termination network) to 0.68% (continuous fibers) and stress\ndifferentials dropping from ~65% (fiber-termination network) to 2.3%\n(continuous fibers). Fiber tortuosity delayed the point at which mechanical\nresponse was governed by fiber structure.

Monte Carlo (MC) methods provide an accessible and intuitive framework;\nhowever, their standard implementation - perturbing deterministic trajectories\nwith independent Gaussian noise - rests on assumptions poorly suited to\nepidemic processes, which are inherently stochastic, temporally correlated, and\nhighly variable, especially in small populations or under slow transmission. In\nthis study, we investigate the structure of stochastic variability in the\nclassic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model across a range of\nepidemiological regimes, and assess whether it can be represented within the\nindependent Gaussian noise framework. We show that continuous-time Markov chain\n(CTMC) trajectories consistently exhibit super-Poissonian variability and\nstrong temporal dependence. Through coverage analysis, we further demonstrate\nthat independent Gaussian noise systematically underestimates the variability\nof the underlying stochastic process, leading to overly optimistic conclusions\nabout parameter identifiability. In addition, we propose a hybrid simulation\napproach that introduces time- and amplitude-dependent variability into\ndeterministic ODE trajectories, preserving computational efficiency while\ncapturing key features of epidemic stochasticity. Our findings highlight the\nlimitations of the standard MC algorithm and provide a pathway for\nincorporating more realistic noise structures into epidemic inference."}

While large language models (LLMs) show\npromise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction\nremains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured\nexperimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM\nperformance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces\ngenerated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate\nthat our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses\nthe capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our\nresults reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively\ndistill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach\nenables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,\nand (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered\ntraining data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning\ndistillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs."}

However, these models are heavily dependent on data\nstructures, limiting their stability and generalization capabilities across\ntasks, thereby hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address\nthis issue, we propose a chaotic dynamics event signal processing framework\ninspired by the dorsal visual pathway of the brain. Specifically, we utilize\nContinuous-coupled Neural Network (CCNN) to encode the event stream. CCNN\nencodes polarity-invariant event sequences as periodic signals and\npolarity=changing event sequences as chaotic signals. We then use continuous\nwavelet transforms to analyze the dynamical states of CCNN neurons and\nestablish the high-order mappings of the event stream. The effectiveness of our\nmethod is validated through integration with conventional classification\nnetworks, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the\nN-Caltech101 and N-CARS datasets, with results of 84.3% and 99.9%,\nrespectively. Our method improves the accuracy of event camera-based object\nclassification while significantly enhancing the generalization and stability\nof event representation.

Many studies\nhave documented the properties of motor adaptation, yet the underlying\nmechanisms of motor adaptation remain imperfectly understood. In this study, we\npropose a computational analysis of adaptation to a visuomotor rotation task\nand examine it through an experiment. Our analysis suggests that two distinct\nprocesses contribute to produce adaptation: one which straightens trajectories,\nand another which redirects trajectories. We designed a visuomotor rotation\ntask in a 3D virtual environment where human participants performed a pointing\ntask using a head-mounted display controller represented by a cursor that was\nvisually rotated by an angular deviation relative to its actual position. We\nobserved that: (1) the trajectories were initially curved and misdirected, and\nbecame straighter and better directed with learning; (2) the straightening\nprocess occurred faster than the redirection process. These findings are\nconsistent with our computational analysis and disclose a new and different\nperspective on motor adaptation."}

However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of\nsuboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational\ncomplexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but\nparticipants' resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when\ntasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect\ninformation needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones\nthat engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced\nthe efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision\ntask. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational\nstrategies were effective, and favored complex representations when\nineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or\ncomplex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an\nepistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory\nof perception."}

We show that, in particular, the\nparticipation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality,\nis highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected\nestimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On\nsynthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true\nknown dimensionality.
