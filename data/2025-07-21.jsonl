Notably, the method remains theoretically valid even\nnear irregular points, such as singularities and boundaries, where traditional\ntesting approaches often break down. In this paper, we evaluate its practical\nperformance on a collection of biologically motivated models from\nphylogenetics. While the method performs remarkably well across different\nsettings, we catalogue a number of issues that should be considered for\neffective application."}

The ability to detect the directionality of such\ntrends is crucial for understanding and managing the dynamics of natural\nsystems. Nevertheless, identifying the key observable quantities that capture\nsuch directional behaviour poses a major challenge. In this study, we propose\nthat translating ecological data into a network framework is a valuable\nstrategy to measure system stability and evolution. We examine the Tangled\nNature model as a test case, evaluating network entropy, species diversity, and\nthe clustering coefficient as metrics of network stability and directionality."}

Wei D. Lu is the\n  corresponding author. 4 figures are included in 15 pages", "summary": "A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the\ndetailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding\nof cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal\nconnectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements\ncombine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a\nframework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep\nlearning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential\nequations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the\nbiophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead\nto emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this\nframework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal\nstate transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural\nrepresentations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that\nthese cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational\ndynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism\nunifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and\noscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we\nshow that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative\ntasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for\nperforming complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling\nframework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering\na unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal\nlearning in the brain."}

However current methods face inherent\nchallenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in\nidentifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose\nAutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive\ndomain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to\nprogressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The\ncomprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline\nmethods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two\nclinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate\nAutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving\nexpert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their\nmechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we\nfind that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug\ndesign which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further\nrevealing why it works.

Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this\nframework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we\nreveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two\npathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal\nstream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is\ncaptured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing\nthe specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a\nconvergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and\nartificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world."}

Furthermore,\nthe potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is\nunexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow\nmodel (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference\nprocedures.

In this work, we propose a novel\npipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational\nspaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into\nMD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble\nlearning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of\ngenerated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative\nrepresentation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into\n2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use\nthree rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new\nconformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that\ninterpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained\nfrom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that\nrepresenting proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying\nadvanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an\nefficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed\nframework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures."}
