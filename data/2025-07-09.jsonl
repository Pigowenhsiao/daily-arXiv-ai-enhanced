Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,\npresumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform\ncomputationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In\nresponse, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in\nprotein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The\nkey idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the\nfolding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of\nits binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as\na proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be\nfine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited\nbinding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first\ndeep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical\nforce-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up."}

A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these\nconnections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a\nheterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an\nessential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel\nperspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and\nartificial intelligence."}

Neural systems are undoubtedly\ncomplex, necessitating principled and automated tools to abstract away details\nto organize and incrementally build intuition. We argue that systems with the\nsame effective behavior should be abstracted by their ideal representative,\ni.e., archetype, defined by its asymptotic dynamical structure. We propose a\nlibrary of archetypical computations and a new measure of dissimilarity that\nallows us to group systems based on their effective behavior by explicitly\nconsidering both deformations that break topological conjugacy as well as\ndiffeomorphisms that preserve it. The proposed dissimilarity can be estimated\nfrom observed trajectories. Numerical experiments demonstrate our method's\nability to overcome previously reported fragility of existing (dis)similarity\nmeasures for approximate continuous attractors and high-dimensional recurrent\nneural networks. Although our experiments focus on working memory systems, our\ntheoretical approach naturally extends to general mechanistic interpretation of\nrecurrent dynamics in both biological and artificial neural systems. We argue\nthat abstract dynamical archetypes, rather than detailed dynamical systems,\noffer a more useful vocabulary for describing neural computation."}

We hypothesize that humans leverage\nexperience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were\naccessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a\nnovel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for\n\"preplay\" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.\nPreplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,\nadaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional\nplanning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better\npredicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in\na small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize\nto these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a\npartially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask\nPreplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel\nCraftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate\nthat Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually\nlearn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the\nsame capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging\nmultitask environments."}
