This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research.

Melanoma is one of the\ndeadliest forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. It is\ncharacterized by the overproduction of melanin by the increased in cell\nproliferation. Melanogenesis, the production of melanin is by\nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) which stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP)\nproduction to increase melanocyte production. Through the use of\nmethylxanthines, theophylline proliferation rate can be decreased by increasing\ncell differentiation. One of the basic principles of cell biology is the\nselectivity of differentiation and proliferation, where cells usually grow or\ndifferentiate but not both. This study aimed to collect baseline data of\nuntreated B16-F10 melanoma cells to determine morphology and doubling time of\nuntreated cells. This data was further compared to results from varied\nconcentration treatments of theophylline.
