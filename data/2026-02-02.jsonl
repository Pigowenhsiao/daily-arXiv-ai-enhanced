However, how this ability is assessed, and what conclusions are drawn from experiments, depends on the theoretical ideas that inspire the research. Here, we review both theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches based on a systematic web-based literature search on tactile localization. After presenting current theories of tactile localization, we discuss task characteristics that differentiate current methodology for tactile localization into at least 8 distinct types of experimental tasks. We describe these tasks, discuss their, often implicit, underlying assumptions and cognitive requirements, and relate them to the theoretical approaches. We then compare, in an exemplary manner, the tactile localization results reported by a subset of studies and demonstrate how some methods are associated with specific biases, illustrating that the choice of experimental method significantly affects the conclusions drawn from the results. Our review suggests that the field currently lacks a clear concept of the specific processes induced by the various experimental tasks and, thus, calls for concerted efforts to clarify and unify currently diverse, fragmented, and partly inconsistent theoretical underpinnings of tactile spatial processing, flanked by dedicated data sharing to allow across-study analysis."}

We develop a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion framework to investigate competing species in landscapes shaped by climate variability, pollution, resource heterogeneity, and cooperation. Here, temperature follows low-frequency oscillations, while pollution and resources diffuse from localized sources. Growth is governed by a dynamic carrying capacity integrating abiotic stress with an endogenous, pollution-sensitive cooperation field.\n  Numerical simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of persistent spatial organization, including dominance segregation and stable competitive boundaries. Quantitative analyses-using boundary geometry, fractal dimension, and spatial entropy-demonstrate a transition from intermixed initial states to low-complexity, quasi-stationary configurations. Coexistence occurs through distinct strategies: one species occupies more area, while the other maintains higher local densities. Cooperation enhances resilience but collapses in polluted zones, creating heterogeneous \"social buffering.\"\n  We further introduce a hybrid inverse modeling framework using a Swin Transformer to infer high-dimensional parameters from only two temporal snapshots. Trained on synthetic data, the model accurately recovers demographic, diffusive, and environmental-sensitivity parameters. While it achieves reliable short-term spatial predictions, long-term forecasts diverge due to the intrinsic sensitivity of nonlinear systems. This unified framework links sparse observations to mechanistic dynamics, advancing biodiversity forecasting under accelerating global change."}

Integrated into the backbone of state-of-the-art GFMs, Gengram achieves substantial gains (up to 14%) across several functional genomics tasks.

Stochastic logistic models (SLMs), which treat species as independent -- akin to ideal gases in physics -- and incorporate environmental noise, reproduce many single-species patterns but cannot account for the pairwise covariation observed in microbiome data. Here we introduce an interacting stochastic logistic model (ISLM) that minimally extends the SLM by sampling an ensemble of random interaction networks chosen to preserve these single-species laws. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we map the model's phase diagram -- stable, chaotic, and unbounded-growth regimes -- where the transition from stable fixed-point to chaos is controlled by network sparsity and interaction heterogeneity via a May-like instability line. Going beyond mean-field theory to account for finite communities, we derive an estimator of an effective stability parameter that quantifies distance to the edge of instability and can be inferred from the width of the distribution of pairwise covariances in empirical species-abundance data. Applying this framework to synthetic data, environmental microbiomes, and human gut cohorts indicates that these communities tend to operate near the edge of instability. Moreover, gut communities from healthy individuals cluster closer to this edge and exhibit broader, more heterogeneous associations, whereas dysbiosis-associated states shift toward more stable regimes -- enabling discrimination across conditions such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. Together, our results connect macroecological laws, interaction-network ensembles, and May's stability theory, suggesting that complex communities may benefit from operating near a dynamical phase transition."}

Existing discrete diffusion and flow-based methods rely on reversing fixed corruption processes or following prescribed probability paths, which can force generation through low-likelihood regions and require countless sampling steps. We introduce Minimal-action discrete Schrödinger Bridge Matching (MadSBM), a rate-based generative framework for peptide design that formulates generation as a controlled continuous-time Markov process on the amino-acid edit graph. To yield probability trajectories that remain near high-likelihood sequence neighborhoods throughout generation, MadSBM 1) defines generation relative to a biologically informed reference process derived from pre-trained protein language model logits and 2) learns a time-dependent control field that biases transition rates to produce low-action transport paths from a masked prior to the data distribution. We finally introduce guidance to the MadSBM sampling procedure towards a specific functional objective, expanding the design space of therapeutic peptides; to our knowledge, this represents the first-ever application of discrete classifier guidance to Schrödinger bridge-based generative models."}

The database contains over 1000 curated models and an even larger number of non-curated models. All the models are stored in the machine-readable format, SBML. Although SBML can be translated into the human readable Antimony format, analyzing the models can still be time consuming. In order to bridge this gap, a LLM (large language model) assistant was created to analyze the BioModels and allow interaction between the user and the model using natural language. By doing so, a user can easily and rapidly extract the salient points in a given model. Our analysis workflow involved 'chunking' BioModels and converting them to plain text using llama3, and then embedding them in a ChromaDB database. The user-provided query was also embedded, and a similarity search was performed between the query and the BioModels in ChromaDB to extract the most relevant BioModels. The BioModels were then used as context to create the most accurate output in the chat between the user and the LLM. This approach greatly minimized the chance of hallucination and kept the LLM focused on the problem at hand."}

The tools used are graph-theoretic", "summary": "Phylogenetic reconciliation seeks to explain host-symbiont co-evolution by mapping parasite trees onto host trees through events such as cospeciation, duplication, host switching, and loss. Finding an optimal reconciliation that ensures time feasibility is computationally hard when timing information is incomplete, and the complexity remains open when host switches are restricted by a fixed maximum distance $d$. While the case $d=2$ is known to be polynomial, larger values are unresolved. In this paper, we study the cases $d=3$ and $d=4$. We show that although arbitrarily large cycles may occur, it suffices to check only bounded-size cycles (we provide a complete list), provided the reconciliation satisfies acyclicity (i.e., time-feasibility) in a stronger sense. These results do not resolve the general complexity, but highlight structural properties that advance the understanding of distance-bounded reconciliations."}

Five major variants of concern, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, have been identified. By August 2022, over 12.95 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences had been deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database, offering an unprecedented opportunity to investigate viral evolution and epistatic interactions. Recent advances in epistatic inference, exemplified by Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (Zeng et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2022), have generated numerous Circos plots illustrating genetic inter-dependencies. In this study, we constructed a dataset of 1,984 Circos plots and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to classify and identify the corresponding genomic variants. The CNN effectively captured complex epistatic features, achieving an accuracy of 99.26\\%. These findings demonstrate that CNN-based models can serve as powerful tools for exploring higher-order genetic dependencies, providing deeper insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptive mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2."}

One important area of application is leukaemia research, where leukaemia cells are genetically modified in preclinical studies to explore new therapeutic targets for reducing leukaemic burden. In advanced experiments, these studies are often conducted in mice and generate time-resolved data, the analysis of which may reveal growth-inhibiting effects of the investigated gene modifications. However, the experimental data is often times evaluated using statistical tests which compare measurements from only two different time points. This approach does not only reduce the time series to two instances but also neglects biological knowledge about cell mechanisms. Such knowledge, translated into mathematical models, expands the power to investigate and understand effects of modifications on underlying mechanisms based on experimental data. We utilise two population growth models -- an exponential and a logistic growth model -- to capture cell dynamics over the whole experimental time horizon and to consider all measurement times jointly. This approach enables us to derive modification effects from estimated model parameters. We demonstrate that the exponential growth model recognises simulated scenarios more reliably than the other candidate model and than a statistical test. Moreover, we apply the population growth models to evaluate the efficacy of candidate gene knockouts in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of acute leukaemia."}

Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics."}

While genetic drivers are well-characterized, growing evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, particularly those involving drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), play a pivotal role in solid tumor relapse. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of DTP-induced resistance, we develop a stochastic agent-based model (ABM) of solid tumor evolution that couples macroscopic population dynamics with microscopic epigenetic state inheritance during the cell cycle. Our simulations accurately reproduce the temporal progression of relapse observed in experimental studies, capturing the dynamic transition from sensitive cells to DTPs, and ultimately to stable resistant phenotypes under prolonged therapy. By explicitly modeling the epigenetic plasticity of individual cells, our model bridges the gap between cellular heterogeneity and population-level tumor evolution. Furthermore, we performed \\textit{in silico} clinical trials using virtual patient cohorts to evaluate therapeutic outcomes, demonstrating that optimized adaptive treatment strategies can significantly delay tumor relapse compared to standard dosing. This study provides a quantitative framework for dissecting DTP-driven resistance mechanisms and designing more effective, biologically informed therapeutic strategies."}

Theoretical studies have mainly focused on Lotka-Volterra models, which do not account for food source dynamics. In contrast, consumer-resource models, which consider food source dynamics, are less explored. In particular, it is still unclear what physical mechanisms control oscillatory dynamics at a single population level, a phenomenon which can only be captured by a consumer-resource model. Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur around steady state if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This interplay of timescales allows us to rationalize the emergence of oscillatory dynamics when adding various biophysical ingredients to the model. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations. Requiring multiple simultaneous food sources has the opposite effect. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations around a fixed point. We further demonstrate that such damped oscillatory behavior is correlated with persistent oscillatory behavior in a noisy environment. We hope our work will motivate further investigations of consumer-resource models to improve descriptions of environments where food source distributions vary in space and time."}
