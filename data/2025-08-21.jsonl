On\nEarth, they play critical roles in sustaining microbial life within soils,\npermafrost, and groundwater environments and their availability shape microbial\ncommunity compositions, activity, and adaptability to changes in environmental\nconditions, enabling communities to persist over millennial timescales. The\ncounterpart to aqueous-soluble organics is the insoluble organic matter pool\nthat makes up the largest portion of organic matter in natural samples and\nincludes most types of organic signatures indicative of biological processes.\nEmploying a range of sample preparation, molecular separation, detection, and\nimaging techniques enables the characterization of both labile (i.e., soluble\nand reactive) and recalcitrant (i.e., insoluble, non-reactive; include\nmacromolecules) organic pools. Multiple orthogonal analytical modalities\nstrengthen interpretations of signatures that we associate with biology as we\nknow it and don't know it, by constraining possible abiotic sources, validating\nmeasurements across distinct techniques, and ensuring flexibility to\ninterrogate diverse organic chemistries encountered in Martian subsurface\nenvironments.

In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov\nsplitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large\nnegative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by\nantibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To\nexplain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here\nwithin a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of\ncharacteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations\npredict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that\ncoherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect\nphoton emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus\ndimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on\nfluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could\nextend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate\noperations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits.

Detecting and\nquantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging\nfrom multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is\nparticularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to\nmajor evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti\nFranceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by\nscreening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by\nchance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated\nwith negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived\ndescendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth\nto assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under\nchallenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by\nBonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model\nmultilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and\nbetween-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we\ndevelop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level\nfitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites\nunder multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see\nsensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of\nthis methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic,\ntime-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population\ncompositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent\nwith baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards\nrigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects."}

The demand for higher\nspatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the\ndevelopment of high-density electrode arrays.

To address these issues, modern BCI systems often\nemploy channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically\ntask-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work\nproposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based\nChannel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity\nCoefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By\nselecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%\nimprovement in multi-class classification accuracy.

It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves\nas a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $\\mu_i$ is estimated\nby averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This\ngives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a\ncorrelation index for the strength of this association.

Recent trends in climatic change,\ncharacterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures,\nand above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe,\nincluding Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of\na system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept\nof diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent\nparameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality\nrate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts\nacross space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory\nbirds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has\nnon-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical\nsimulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany\n(2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement\nwith the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed\nspreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly\ndriven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and\nvectors.
