These bioprocesses require high concentrations of\nnutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to\nsustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity.

Experimentally screening the various cell culture media\nconfigurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and\nlaborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools\nto understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the\npairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity\ncoefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of\ntwo amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC\ngroup interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the\nmulti-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media.

This study develops\na general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming\nthat mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting\nindividuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two\nspecies. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing\nthe ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when\nthe respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary\ndifferential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general\nprinciples governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the\nemergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit\ncycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in\nstrictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for\ncharacterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights\nthe effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density\ndependence."}

Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems\nof differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental\nobservations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological\nprocesses has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to\ninfer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying\nequations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in\nbiological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families:\nregression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition\ntechniques.

To improve the\nperformance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and\nsterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological\nproblem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical\nanalysis. In a series of papers, Due\\~nas, Nu\\~nez, and Obaya have developed a\npowerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with\nd-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third\nderivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from\npopulation dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive\nsign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincar\\'e map. This remark\nallows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep\ngeometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the\ndynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable\nconditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical\nbehavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even\nincorporating seasonality. This paper generalizes and improves many recent\nresults in the literature."}

Because of the high costs associated\nwith mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high\nproduct titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of\nnutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to\nsustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the\ndesired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often\nsolubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the\nsolution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media\nconfigurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and\nlaborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools\nto understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the\npairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity\ncoefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of\ntwo amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC\ngroup interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the\nmulti-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data\ncollected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system\namino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation\npredictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and\nquaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model\nas a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by\nreplacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational\npredictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex\nmixtures."}

This review\nsystematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of\nexisting 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,\nii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud\nsemantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio\n(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)\nconducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative\nnetworks and sim-to-real learning strategies.

For cross-comparison of results from\nsufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score\nas a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat\nnuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of\nsimilarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching\nof query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous\nsimilarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity\nmeasures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as\nall-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual\npractice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and\nthe diversity of subset selection.

To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be\nallocated between sites according to their \"demands\"; this requires extra\nnanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the\nnanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement\nmodel for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in\nwhich bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients.

We present\nsimulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer\narrangements.
