We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfor evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural\ndisorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:\n(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor\n(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking\ntwelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,\nregression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the\nDisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error\nanalyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under\ndisorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.\nNotably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in\ndisordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.\nDisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded\nframework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical\nscenarios."}

Although their main established function lacks\ndirect evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as\nodorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of\nOBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and\nproteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in\nboth, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the\nconjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense,\npotentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to\nthe tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types\nincluding ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured\nreview, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations\nsuch as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP\nfunction and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational\nanalyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated\nwith large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point\nmutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural\ncharacteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us\nto explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology. Our\noverview consolidates current knowledge on putative human OBP functions, their\nexpression patterns, and structural features. Finally, it provides an overview\non applications, highlighting emerging hypotheses and future research\ndirections within olfactory and non-olfactory roles."}

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output.

This enables efficient and accurate simulation of systems in which\nstochasticity plays a key role but is not required uniformly across the domain.\nWe specify the full mathematical formulation of the SRCM, including conversion\nreactions, hybrid kinetic rules, and consistent numerical updates. The method\nis validated across several one-dimensional test systems, including simple\ndiffusion from a region of high concentration, the formation of a morphogen\ngradient, and the propagation of FKPP travelling waves.

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide\nthe development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community.

This\napproach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization\nlandscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process\nwithout distorting optimal parameters.
