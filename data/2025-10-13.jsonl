We address this limitation by enforcing physical\nvalidity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a\nuniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the\nprovisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically\nvalid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,\nwhich exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable\nand fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,\nour module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end\nffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising\nsteps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically\nvalid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model\nachieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion\nbaselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while\nguaranteeing physical validity."}

Here\nwe combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements\nfrom literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment\nconditions and necessary alignment precision.

One major obstacle lies in\nmethodological limitations: most studies rely on non-invasive neural measures\nwith limited spatial or temporal resolution making it difficult to disentangle\nproper NCCs from concurrent cognitive processes. Additionally, the relatively\nlow sensitivity of non-invasive neural measures limits the interpretation of\nnull findings in studies targeting proper NCCs. In this review, we discuss how\nhuman intracranial recordings can advance the search for NCCs, by offering high\nspatiotemporal resolution, improved signal sensitivity, and broad cortical and\nsubcortical coverage. We review studies that have examined NCCs at the level of\nsingle neurons and populations of neurons, and evaluate their implications on\nthe debates between cognitive and sensory theories of consciousness. Finally,\nwe highlight the limits of current intracranial human recordings and propose\nfuture directions based on emerging technologies and novel experimental\nparadigms."}

Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major\nlineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165\nneutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes\nrepresented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between\nisolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise\nlocal evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence,\nand the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection,\nglobal attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model\nachieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146\nWHO-classified \"uncertain\" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent\nemergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution.

We illustrate our findings in the context of the host--host\ninteractions among plants in plant-mycorrhizal fungi (MF) mutualisms. The\ncoordination game payoff structure captures the insight that mutualistic\nstrategies lead to robust advantages only after such \"biological markets\" reach\na certain scale. The game gives rise to three types of Nash equilibria, which\ncorrespond to the states derived in studies of the ancestral reconstruction of\nthe mycorrhizal symbiosis in seed plants. We show that all types of Nash\nequilibria correspond to steady states of a dynamical system describing the\nunderlying evolutionary process. We then employ methods from large deviation\ntheory on discrete-time Markov processes to study stochastic evolutionary\ndynamics. We provide a sharp analytical characterization of the stochastic\nsteady states and of the transition dynamics across Nash equilibria and employ\nsimulations to illustrate these results in special cases. We find that the\nmutualism is abandoned and re-established several times through evolutionary\ntime, but the mutualism may persist the majority of time. Changes that reduce\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio associated with the symbiosis increase the likelihood\nof its abandonment. While the mutualism establishment and abandonment could\nresult from direct transitions across the mutualistic and non-mutualistic\nstates, it is far more likely for such transitions to occur indirectly through\nintermediate partially mutualistic states.

However, most methods often overlook the dynamic\ngeneration process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data,\nwithin the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main\nparadigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests',\nwhich we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall\nstructure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly\nuse the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and\nthe hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e.,\nfine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying\nthe adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive\nTopological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT.
