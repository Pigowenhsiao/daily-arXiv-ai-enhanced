To explore the\nopportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a\nMolecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how\nLLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in\ntraining. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,\nobtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein\nsystems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the\nprediction of other conformational states.

Many deep\nlearning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify\nimages.

Some\npicture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being\nutilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The\nsuggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how\npicture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study\nspecifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more\ncomplex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when\nimage resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may\nlearn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are\nincorporated into the training process.

Although EAMs have been combined with\nframeworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level\ntheories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid\nto their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we\ncombine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to\ninvestigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort\narising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM.

Although a preliminary\ninvestigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability\nunder two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how\nsystematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore,\nthe purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic\nvariations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived\nmaneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye\nmovements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose\ntime constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was\nsystematically manipulated.

Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central\nDogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of\ninformation: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across\ngenerations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to\nfacilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information.\nWe argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a\nunifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of\nlabour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular\norganisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a\ntheoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution.\nSpecifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma\noriginates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary\nconflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma\nas an informational relationship between components of a system, this\ngeneralisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological\nhierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin."}
