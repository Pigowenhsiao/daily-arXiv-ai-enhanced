Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size\nprofiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and\npredict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA\nImmunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment\nplasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were\nquantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables\n(concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were\nanalyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first\nimaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression\nmodels. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were\nperformed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n =\n60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher\ncfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs\n(bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (> 300 bp). The\nproportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory\npower (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP\n(odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95%\nCI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for\nconfounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status,\ntumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations.\nBootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\\pm$ 4.17%\nand positive predictive value of 55.6 $\\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion:\ncfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate\nrelapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1\nimmunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation.

However, current refinement\nprotocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational\nstates become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an\nautomated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the\ndivide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of\ngeometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from\nobserved scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density\nconstraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents\ntangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models\ninitialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections\nrevolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can\nalso address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement.\nThis work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic\nmethodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture\nprotein dynamics at atomic resolution."}

The\nsystem models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology\nframework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its\nsignificant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never\nbeen investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type\nnature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that\nrender conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions\nbeyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models.\nTechnically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between\nparabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications,\nwhile the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied\nperspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as\nsolutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity\nconstraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this\nchallenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that\ncreate a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's\nparameters.

One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain\nframeworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network\nstability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease\nprogression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and\nglial responses and vascular mechanisms.
