In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment."}

The lipid-deficient de-clear cell differentiated (DCCD) ccRCC subtype, defined by multi-omics analyses, is associated with adverse outcomes even in early-stage disease. Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction. The consistent predictions identified patients with the poorest clinical outcomes. This cross-scale paradigm unifies molecular biology, computational pathology, and quantitative radiology into a biologically grounded strategy for preoperative noninvasive molecular phenotyping of ccRCC."}

Supplementary materials included after the main text, references at the end of supplementary materials", "summary": "Background: Stress and negative affect play significant roles in developing psychosis. Bayesian analyses applied to the conditioned hallucinations (CH) task suggest that hallucinations arise when maladaptive prior beliefs outweigh sensory evidence. Prior weighting is linked to hallucination severity, yet the nature of these priors remains unclear. Negative affect may influence the strength of maladaptive priors. We hypothesized that, under stress, participants will show increased CH rates and prior weighting, with this effect more pronounced in patients.\n  Methods: This study employs a modified CH task using valenced linguistic stimuli and stress and non-stress affective manipulations. The sample for this pilot study included those at risk for psychosis and patients with first episode psychosis (N=12) and healthy controls (N=15). The objective of this study was first to validate this affective version of the CH task and then to demonstrate an effect of affect on CH rates and prior weighting.\n  Results: Replicating past results, patients had higher CH rates (b = 0.061, p < 0.001) and prior weighting (b = 0.097, p < 0.001) for session 1 compared to controls (n=15) across conditions. Further, runs with stress manipulations had higher prior weighting across patients and controls compared to runs with non-stress manipulations (b = 0.054, p = 0.033).\n  Conclusions: This study validates this affective version of the CH task and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between affective state and prior weighting. Future work will be aimed at confirming and extending these findings, with the objective of developing biomarkers of early psychosis.\n  Key words: Schizophrenia, Affect, Priors, Computational Psychiatry, Clinical High Risk Population, Psychotic Symptoms"}

We introduce a simple, model-independent metric, Ω, that quantifies OEE as the residence-time-weighted contribution of each attractor's cycle length across the sequence of attractors realized over time. Ω is zero for single-attractor dynamics and grows with the number and persistence of distinct cyclic phenotypes, separating enduring innovation from transient noise. Using Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) as a unifying testbed, we compare classical Boolean dynamics with biologically motivated non-classical mechanisms (probabilistic context switching, annealed rule mutation, paraconsistent logic, modal necessary/possible gating, and quantum-inspired superposition/entanglement) under homogeneous and heterogeneous updating schemes. Our results support the view that undecidability-adjacent, state-dependent mechanisms -- implemented as contextual switching, conditional necessity/possibility, controlled contradictions, or correlated branching -- are enabling conditions for sustained novelty. At the end of our manuscript we outline a practical extension of Ω to continuous/hybrid state spaces, positioning Ω as a portable benchmark for OEE in discrete biological modeling and a guide for engineering evolvable synthetic circuits."}

Recent work has proposed that probabilistic representations arise naturally in task-optimized neural networks trained without explicitly probabilistic inductive biases. However, prior work has lacked clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations, those that perform transformations characteristic of probabilistic computation, from heuristic neural codes that merely reformat inputs. We propose a novel information bottleneck framework, the functional information bottleneck (fIB), that crucially evaluates a neural representation based not only on its statistical sufficiency but also on its minimality, allowing us to disambiguate heuristic from probabilistic coding. To demonstrate the power of this framework, we study a variety of task-optimized neural networks that had been suggested to develop probabilistic representations in earlier work: networks trained to perform static inference tasks (such as cue combination and coordinate transformation) or dynamic state estimation tasks (Kalman filtering). In contrast to earlier claims, our minimality requirement reveals that probabilistic representations fail to emerge in these networks: they do not develop minimal codes of Bayesian posteriors in their hidden layer activities, and instead rely on heuristic input recoding. Therefore, it remains an open question under which conditions truly probabilistic representations emerge in neural networks. More generally, our work provides a stringent framework for identifying probabilistic neural codes. Thus, it lays the foundation for systematically examining whether, how, and which posteriors are represented in neural circuits during complex decision-making tasks."}

This study develops a stochastic $SEI_sI_aR-B$ compartmental model to analyse HPAI transmission, explicitly accounting for environmental pathogen reservoirs and noise intensities through Wiener processes. The positivity and boundedness of solutions are established, and the disease-free and endemic equilibria are analytically derived. The basic reproduction number is determined using the next-generation matrix method. Numerical simulations confirm that the model dynamics are consistent with theoretical analysis and illustrate how stochastic fluctuations significantly influence disease persistence. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) identifies the transmission rate from asymptomatic infectious cattle ($β_a$) as the primary driver of transmission. The model effectively captures the dynamics of environmental variability affecting HPAI spread, suggesting that effective control strategies must prioritise the early detection and isolation of asymptomatic carriers alongside environmental management."}

The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments."}
