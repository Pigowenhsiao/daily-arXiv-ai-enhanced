However,\nprior approaches for exploring the alternative branching structures were\ncomputationally inefficient for long sequences.\n  Results: We present a novel algorithm that partitions the parameter space,\nidentifying all distinct branching structures (optimal under different\nbranching parameters) for a given RNA sequence using the fewest possible\nminimum free energy computations. Our method efficiently computes the full\nparameter-space partition and the associated optimal structures, enabling a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the structural landscape across parameter choices.\nWe apply this algorithm to the Archive II benchmarking dataset, assessing the\nmaximum attainable prediction accuracy for each sequence under the\nreparameterized multiloop model.

The current\nmodel simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a\nlarge-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis\nis a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3\nmillion equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125\nspecies and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000\ncells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades,\nECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The\nalgorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nthat are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on\ndemand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes\nbrush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input\nmolecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and\nmultiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple\nscales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully\nfunctional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction,\nand model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or\nexperimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the\ntesting of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor."}

The general\nchemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to\nimprove predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target\npotency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been\nsuccessfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that\nenabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network\nmodels such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the\nGROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)\nsignificantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network\nmodels. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning\nKERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.\nAdditionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more\naccurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property\nprediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT\nmodel on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference\nin industrial drug discovery workflows."}

While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical\nsophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and\nheterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy\naging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age\ngap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain\nage gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's\npredicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The\nresulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with\nrecent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and\nseverity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their\nmethodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical\npopulations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces\na principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in\ngraph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the\nanatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong\ntheoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust\nestimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,\nmachine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path\nforward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research\ndirections in personalized medicine."}
