Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs\n(named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs.\nDDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most\ncomputational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over\ngenerating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians'\ninterpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each\ndrug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input\ncontext, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE\ngeneration by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel\npairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text\ngeneration. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting\nstructural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to\nselect pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise\nknowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected\nbiological functions into the LM. Experiments on two professional datasets show\nthat PKAG-DDI outperforms existing methods in DDIE text generation, especially\nin challenging inductive scenarios, indicating its practicality and\ngeneralization."}

To overcome this screening bottleneck, we introduce\nLatent-X, an all-atom protein design model that enables a new paradigm of\nprecision AI design. Given a target protein epitope, Latent-X jointly generates\nthe all atom structure and sequence of the protein binder and target, directly\nmodelling the non-covalent interactions essential for specific binding. We\ndemonstrate its efficacy across two therapeutically relevant modalities through\nextensive wet lab experiments, testing as few as 30-100 designs per target. For\nmacrocyclic peptides, Latent-X achieves experimental hit rates exceeding 90% on\nall evaluated benchmark targets. For mini-binders, it consistently produces\npotent candidates against all evaluated benchmark targets, with binding\naffinities reaching the low nanomolar and picomolar range - comparable to those\nof approved therapeutics - whilst also being highly specific in mammalian\ndisplay. In direct comparisons with the state-of-the-art models AlphaProteo,\nRFdiffusion and RFpeptides under identical conditions demonstrates, Latent-X\ngenerates binders with higher hit rates and better binding affinities, and\nuniquely creates structurally diverse binders, including complex beta-sheet\nfolds. Its end-to-end process is an order of magnitude faster than existing\nmulti-step computational pipelines. By drastically improving the efficiency and\nsuccess rate of de novo design, Latent-X represents a significant advance\ntowards push-button biologics discovery and a valuable tool for protein\nengineers.

Previous studies have added mortality of immature\nindividuals to the maturation delay in discrete population models, finding that\nincreasing the delay results in a decreased population level at equilibrium.\nFurthermore, increasing the maturation delay beyond a critical threshold\nultimately leads to the extinction of the modeled species. Because maturation\ndelays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, clearly, maturation\ndelays must also have a positive benefit leading to a trade-off. We explore\nsuch a trade-off by deriving a class of discrete single species models with a\nmaturation delay and the realistic assumption of a reproductive trade-off. In\nthis reproductive trade-off, although a prolonged maturation delay decreases\nthe total probability of survival, the delay results in larger body sizes which\nwe assume, based on some fish species, to result in higher fecundity. We\nexamine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density\ndependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature\nindividuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the\nBeverton-Holt model and the Ricker model. Overall, we identify a positive\nmaturation delay that maximizes the population size, which we refer to as\n\"optimal maturation delay\"."}

Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological\nvariables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease.\nThis study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with\ntumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic\nassessment in CRC.\n  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC\n(647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially\nexpressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx\ndatabase. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for\nprognostic markers.

The\nresulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582)\nand integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic\nnomogram.\n  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model\ncomprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as\n0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant\nsurvival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p\n< 0.05) and GSE39582 (p < 0.05).

Recently phylogenetic studies have started to\nfocus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These\ngraphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of\nthe arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph\nwhose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source\nor root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit\nin nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not.\nIn this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of\nsemi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed\ngraphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have\nmore than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the\ntheory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry\npicking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a\n(multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted\nnetwork that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child,\norchard, tree-based or forest-based networks.

Recent efforts have explored\nthe use of multiple genetically diverse hybrid strains to address this. In this\nstudy, we examined whether one single mixed genetic mouse background,\nC57BL/6J;129S2/SvPas (B6;129), could simultaneously recapitulate behavioral\nvariability and display improved phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental and\npsychiatric conditions.

However,\nquantitative analysis of macrophage behavior in in vivo settings remains\nlimited, largely due to the complexity of their diverse morphologies and\nmotility patterns over time. In this study, we present an analytic workflow to\ninvestigate macrophage dynamics in zebrafish. By computing a comprehensive set\nof morpho-kinetic features, we observe that M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2\n(anti-inflammatory) macrophages exhibit distinct behaviors, such as reduced\nshape elongation, more directed movement, and less random-like motion in M1\ncompared to M2 macrophages. Based on these features, we classify macrophages in\nthe transition period into M1-like and M2-like groups. We compare and analyze\ntheir behaviors, which allows us to estimate the timing of the phenotypic\nswitch. In addition, macrophages not expressing Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are\nlocated significantly farther from the wound compared to M1 macrophages. While\nmacrophages unstimulated by wound signaling exhibit some M2-like features, they\ndiffer notably in shape elongation and migration speed. In summary, this study\nprovides a quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior during wound healing\nand suggests distinct behavioral landscapes across different macrophage\nactivation states."}
