Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties."}

Effect-based biomonitoring provides a cost-effective solution. The ToxMate device, which uses videotracking of locomotor behavior in aquatic invertebrates, has proven efficient for real-time detection of micropollutant surges in effluents. To extend the approach, this proof-of-concept study evaluates the potential to formalize behavioral fingerprints from real-time videotracking data to characterize qualitative variations in effluent contamination. We present the first application of a functional data analysis (FDA) framework in ecotoxicology. Data were obtained by simultaneously tracking three sentinel organisms from distinct taxa (a crustacean, an annelid, and a gastropod) during pulse exposures to four chemicals in the laboratory (two metals, one pharmaceutical, and one insecticide). Individual and multispecies responses were analy-zed to determine whether combining species enhances the resolution of contamination fingerprints through multidimensional FDA. Applying the same data-driven approach to field data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) revealed four recurring types of micropollution events. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of behavioral fingerprints to improve wastewater monitoring and reduce pollutant transfer to the environment."}

In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium."}

And then we use phase plane analysis to explore the dynamic mechanism of these firing patterns under different input currents and parametric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns.

Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations."}

Link to github respository", "summary": "Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks.

Software capable of simulating ARGs on a genome scale within a reasonable amount of time are now widely available for most practical use cases. While the inverse problem of inferring ancestries from a sample of haplotypes has seen major progress in the last decade, it does not enjoy the same level of advancement as its counterpart. Up until recently, even moderately sized samples could only be handled using heuristics. In recent years, the possibility of model-based inference for datasets closer to \"real world\" scenarios has become a reality, largely due to the development of threading-based samplers. This article introduces Moonshine.jl, a Julia package that has the ability, among other things, to infer ARGs for samples of thousands of human haplotypes of sizes on the order of hundreds of megabases within a reasonable amount of time. On recent hardware, our package is able to infer an ARG for samples of densely haplotyped (over one marker/kilobase) human chromosomes of sizes up to 10000 in well under a day on data simulated by msprime. Scaling up simulation on a compute cluster is straightforward thanks to a strictly single-threaded implementation. While model-based, it does not resort to threading but rather places restrictions on probability distributions typically used in simulation software in order to enforce sample consistency. In addition to being efficient, a strong emphasis is placed on ease of use and integration into the biostatistical software ecosystem."}

Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics."}

Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \\textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes.

Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data."}

A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data.

To identify motif occurrences, we extract embeddings for overlapping sequence windows and compute their inner products with motif CAVs. This scoring mechanism quantifies how strongly each sequence region expresses the motif concept and naturally detects multiple instances of the same motif within the same protein. Using a dataset of sixty-nine well-characterized motifs with curated positive and negative examples, our method achieves over 85\\% F1 Score for segments strongly expressing the concept and accurately localizes motif positions across diverse protein families.

Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience."}

Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear.\n  We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit.\n  These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired."}
