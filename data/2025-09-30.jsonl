Two-\nand three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the\nrepertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these\ncircuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants,\ntranscription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how\nthese parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the\nrole of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active\ntranscription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory\nprocesses across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric\nregulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to\nthree-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in\nthese architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how\nthe conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the\nbifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve\nunder various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying\nactivity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological\nmechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins\ntransforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of\navailable dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and\nregulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an\nexperimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior\narising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors."}

The bimodality of the posterior\ndistribution arises from bimodality in the estimated coenzyme-A (CoA)\npermeability and inhibition rates. The MCP permeability to CoA was inferred to\nbe either less than $10^{-8.8}$ m/s or greater than $10^{-7.3}$ m/s. In a high\nCoA permeability environment with low rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes produced\nmetabolites by recycling (NAD+)/(NADH). In a low CoA permeability environment\nwith high rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes required external NAD+/H to produce\nmetabolites. Dynamics are consistent with prevailing hypotheses about MCP\nfunction to sequester toxic propionaldehyde, and additional collection of data\npoints between 6 and 24 hours or characterization of enzyme inhibition rates\ncould further reduce uncertainty and provide better permeability estimates."}

In this work, we develop a\nmathematical framework for evaluating the theoretical effectiveness of various\nWNV control methods in Germany. We consider mosquito reduction methods such as\nthe physical removal and destruction of potential mosquito breeding sites, the\nuse of larvicides, and the use of adulticides. We also evaluate the usage of\npersonal protective equipment (PPE) that aims to reduce human-mosquito contact.\nAdopting PPEs may not happen instantly due to different perceptions, social\ninfluence, and the perceived inconvenience and/or frustration that come with\nusing PPEs. Thus, we model a dynamic adoption of PPEs by considering the\nperceived risk of infection, perceived inconvenience of using PPEs, and the\nimitation dynamics due to social influence. Furthermore, the model captures\nvaccination of equids. We formulate and study an optimal control problem, where\nmosquito controls are temperature-dependent and the decision to start or stop\napplying the control methods is influenced by the changes in temperature. The\noptimal control model supports the development and seasonal timing of\ncost-effective mosquito control methods.

By leveraging Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine\nlearning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial\nreductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a\npractical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis."}

Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which\nconflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase\nstructure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows\ncategory detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking\ndata from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their\ntemporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze\ntransitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,\nsuggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize\nscanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was\nthe strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical\nfamiliarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated\nthat syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to\n-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend\ncurrent models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure\nconstruction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,\nsupporting a predictive \"tree-scaffolding\" account of comprehension."}

These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing\nresources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art\nplatform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its\nshared-memory-based implementation.\n  To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed\nagent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is\nthe exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major\nperformance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization\nmechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the\nreceive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based\nsimulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.\n  Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half\na trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional\ncompute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides\nusers with more hardware flexibility."}

Trained on fMRI data recorded\nduring viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and\ncan answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to\nneural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization\nbeyond semantic categories seen during training.

However,\nfinding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly\nstructured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the\nproperty being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior\nworks have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody\nBayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to\nincorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare\nthem to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody\nproperties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of\na protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the\noptimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of\nstructural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for\nstability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating\nthe protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap\nis diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in\nsequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,\nraising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for\nantibodies."}
