In this work, we designed model\narchitectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more\ncomplex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed\ndataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that\nstructural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs\nand feature sets.\n  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing\nwith an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that\nexcludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared\nto classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that\nconvolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all\nthe datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level\noutputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial\nfeatures and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are\nsufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors.

However, QLE breaks\ndown under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak\nrecombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to\norder $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are\nassumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a\ngeneral equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the\nstandard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant\ndynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a\ngeometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes.\nOur analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant\ndynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or\nfourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks.

Using a\nwearable eye tracker, we quantified fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation\narea, direction, peak fixation location, and walking speed.\n  Results: Walking speed declined systematically with worsening vision.\nFixation count increased with greater impairment, reflecting slower travel\ntimes and more frequent sampling.

In particular, the\nspontaneous dynamics in neuronal circuit is known to operate near a highly\nvariable critical state, which intuitively contrasts with the requirement of\nreliable representation. It is intriguing to understand how reliable\nrepresentation could be maintained or even enhanced by critical spontaneous\nstates. We firstly examined the co-existence of the scale-free avalanche in the\nspontaneous activity of mouse visual cortex with restricted representational\ngeometry manifesting representational reliability amid the representational\ndrift with respect to the visual stimulus. To explore how critical spontaneous\nstate influences the neural representation, we built an excitation-inhibition\nnetwork with homeostatic plasticity, which self-organizes to the critical\nspontaneous state. This model successfully reproduced both representational\ndrift and restricted representational geometry observed experimentally, in\ncontrast with randomly shuffled plasticity which causes accumulated drift of\nrepresentational geometry. We further showed that the self-organized critical\nstate enhances the cross-session low-dimensional representation, comparing to\nthe non-critical state, by restricting the synapse weight into a low variation\nspace. Our findings suggest that spontaneous self-organized criticality serves\nnot only as a ubiquitous property of neural systems but also as a functional\nmechanism for maintaining reliable information representation under\ncontinuously changing networks, providing a potential explanation how the brain\nmaintains consistent perception and behavior despite ongoing synaptic rewiring."}
