Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding\nmicrobial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions\nat the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be\nhomogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic\nunderstanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we\nintroduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in\nbiofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of\nthe capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix\nheterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating\nthe bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel\ncell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant\n'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix\narrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a\nsubstantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations\nduring early stage biofilm development."}

This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting\nlatent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages\ntextual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that\ninduce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,\nwhile preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on\nfour benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the\neffectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can\nachieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,\nwith negligible performance degradation on benign samples.

These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in\nlatent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious\nrisks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need\nfor robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models."}
