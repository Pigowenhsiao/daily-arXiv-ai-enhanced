In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep\nconvolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an\nattention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging\nmultiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures\nfine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across\nmultiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013\nand CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant\nimprovements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness\nand generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the\nPDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive\naccuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity\nprediction in structure-based drug discovery."}

One\nsuch candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by\nmeasuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a\nnanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the\nstructure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be\nused to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time\nidentification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the\ncomplexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the\nissue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram\nimages via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time\ninformation in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When\ntested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of\n~$81\\,\\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward\npractical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care.
