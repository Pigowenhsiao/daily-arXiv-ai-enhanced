However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise\nconstraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a\nconstrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring\nstrict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise\nstereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal\nfeasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process,\nscaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate\non challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and\nvacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark\ndataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric\nconstraints with no degradation in structural diversity."}

This\nresearch develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical\nventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from\nobservations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an\nunderstanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires\nthe analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses\nabout advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work\nintroduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems\n(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories\nof these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using\nevolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative\nprecursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery\nsuch as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway\ntoward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is\nanalytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before\nproceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the\ndata-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments\ntoward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using\nempirical and game-theoretic elements."}

Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified\ncomputational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena\nacross both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the\nGenerative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational\nmodel that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity\ngenerative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and\ngeneralization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and\nretrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS\nreproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic\nmemory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in\nepisodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their\ndynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the\nfidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces\nsystematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can\nrecombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled\naccount of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process.\nGENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and\nepisodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human\ncognition."}

Work in progress", "summary": "This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware,\nconsidering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses\nthat can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g.,\n4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a\nsubset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of\nneurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values\nthemselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for\noptimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low\nprecision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression\nefficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a\nvalue required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows\nSpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,\nenabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic\nprocessors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit\nintroduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning\nmethod showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for\nspiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values\n(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs\ncompression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization\nschemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic\nhardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments."}
