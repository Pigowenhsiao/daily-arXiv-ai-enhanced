In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy."}

In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity."}

Recent studies have highlighted the circadian rhythm critical role in AD pathophysiology, implicating circadian clock kinases, such as the Salt-Inducible Kinase 3 (SIK3), as promising therapeutic target. Generative AI models have surpassed traditional methods of drug discovery, untapping the vast unexplored chemical space of drug-like molecules. We present a sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (Seq2Seq-VAE) model guided by an Active Learning (AL) approach to optimize molecular generation. Our pipeline iteratively guided a pre-trained Seq2Seq-VAE model towards the pharmacological landscape relevant to SIK3 using a two-step framework, an inner loop that iteratively improves physiochemical properties profile, drug likeliness and synthesizability, followed by an outer loop that steer the latent space towards high-affinity ligands for SIK3. Our approach introduces feedback-driven optimization without requiring large labeled datasets, making it particularly suited for early-stage drug discovery in under-explored therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the models convergence toward SIK3-specific small molecules with desired properties and high binding affinity. This work highlights the use of generative AI combined with AL for rational drug discovery that can be extended to other protein targets with minimal modifications, offering a scalable solution to the molecular design bottleneck in drug design."}

Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care."}

A mathematical model is proposed to integrate phenotypic evolution, microenvironmental acidification, and tumor density dynamics. Three key mechanisms are incorporated in it: frequency-dependent selection favoring acid-resistant cells below a critical pH, stress-induced phenotypic switching, and a positive feedback loop where resistant cells produce excess acid that intensifies selection pressure. The well-posedness of the model is established. Through numerical simulations across biologically relevant parameter regimes, we identify two therapeutically targetable parameters: baseline acid clearance rate (a proxy for vascular perfusion) and a protection factor (representing acid-resistance \"machinery\" effectiveness) as critical bifurcation parameters for resistance evolution. The model exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics depending on phenotypic plasticity levels. In low-plasticity tumors, both parameters exhibit sharp bifurcations with strong parameter interactions: clearance and protection effects are context-dependent, with therapeutic interventions effective only within specific parameter ranges. In high-plasticity tumors, both parameters produce continuous, monotonic responses with independent, additive effects. These regime-dependent dynamics suggest that treatment strategies should adapt to tumor plasticity: in the formar, targeting perfusion alone is typically sufficient, though sequential therapy may be required if the perfusion rate approaches or exceeds the bifurcation threshold, whereas in the latter treatment might benefit from combination therapies addressing both parameters simultaneously."}

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the main polysaccharides employed as wall materials, including starch, maltodextrin, alginate, pectin, inulin, chitosan, and gum arabic, and discusses how structural interactions and physicochemical properties can benefit the microencapsulation of polyphenols and pigments. The main findings and principles of the major encapsulation techniques, including spray drying, freeze drying, extrusion, emulsification, and coacervation, related to the production of microparticles, were briefly described. Polysaccharides can entrap hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds by physical interactions, forming a barrier around the nucleus or binding to the bioactive compound. Intermolecular binding between polysaccharides in the wall matrix, polyphenols, and pigments in the nucleus can confer up to 90% of encapsulation efficiency, governed mainly by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The mixture of wall polysaccharides in the microparticles synthesis favors the encapsulation solubility, storage stability, bioaccessibility, and bioactivity of the microencapsulate compounds. Clinical trials on the bioefficacy of polyphenols and pigments loaded in polysaccharide microparticles are scarce and require further evidence to reinforce the use of this technology."}

Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment.

Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions."}

We introduce a technique for non-invasive, in vivo measurement of tibial compression force using flexural waves propagating in the tibia. Modeling the tibia as an axially compressed Euler-Bernoulli beam, we show that tibial flexural waves have load-dependent frequency spectra. Specifically, under physiological conditions, peak locations in the acceleration amplitude spectrum shift linearly with the compression force on the tibia, and may be used as proxy force measure. We test the validity of this technique using a proof-of-principle wearable system that generates flexural waves via a skin-mounted mechanical transducer and measures the spectra of these waves using a skin-mounted accelerometer. In agreement with beam theory, data from three participants demonstrate linear relationships between tibial compression force and peak frequency location with Pearson correlation coefficients $r=0.88$--$0.97$ for medial-lateral swaying and $r=0.88$--$0.95$ for walking trials. Our flexural wave-based technique could give rise to a new class of wearable sensors for non-invasive physiological load monitoring and measurement, impacting research in human locomotion, sports medicine, and prosthetic design."}

These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain."}

The morphological adaptive features of the limb long-bones of extant elephants, the heaviest living terrestrial animals, have previously been highlighted; however, their bone microanatomy remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the microanatomy of the six limb long-bones in Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, using comparisons of virtual slices as well as robustness analyses, to understand how they were adapted to heavy weight-bearing. We find that the long bones of elephant limbs display a relatively thick cortex and a medullary area almost entirely filled with trabecular bone. This trabecular bone is highly anisotropic with trabecular orientations reflecting the mechanical load distribution along the limb. The respective functional roles of the bones are reflected in their microanatomy through variations of cortical thickness distribution and main orientation of the trabeculae. We find microanatomical adaptations to heavy weight support that are common to other heavy mammals. Despite these shared characteristics, the long bones of elephants are closer to those of sauropods due to their shared columnar posture, which allows a relaxation of morphofunctional constraints, and thus relatively less robust bones with a thinner cortex than would be expected in such massive animals."}

We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image \"de-blurring\" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP.

Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization."}

This review provides a synthesis of the methodologies for studying higher-order brain connectivity. We propose a fundamental distinction between implicit paradigms, which quantify the statistical strength of group interactions, and explicit paradigms, which construct higher-order structural representations like hypergraphs and topological data analysis. We trace the evolution of each approach, from early Correlation-of-Correlations and information-theoretic concepts of synergy/redundancy, to the edge-centric paradigm and advanced topological methods. Through a critical analysis of conceptual, statistical, and computational challenges, we argue that the future of the field lies not in a single best method, but in a principled integration of these complementary approaches.

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases."}

In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models."}

We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image \"de-blurring\" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets."}

Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance."}

This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments."}

DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand."}

The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences."}

Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data.

Despite significant advances, a fundamental dichotomy persists: neural activity manifests as both discrete spikes of individual neurons and collective waves of populations. Both neural codes correlate with behavior, yet correlation alone cannot determine whether waves exert a causal influence or merely reflect spiking dynamics without causal efficacy. According to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, no amount of observational data--however extensive--can settle this question; causal conclusions require explicit structural assumptions or careful experiment designs that directly correspond to the causal effect of interest. We develop a formal framework that makes this limitation precise and constructive. Formalizing epiphenomenality via the invariance of interventional distributions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we derive a certificate of sufficiency from Pearl's do-calculus that specifies when variables can be removed from the model without loss of causal explainability and clarifies how interventions should be interpreted under different causal structures of spike-wave duality. The purpose of this work is not to resolve the spike-wave debate, but to reformulate it. We shift the problem from asking which signal matters most to asking under what conditions any signal can be shown to matter at all. This reframing distinguishes prediction from explanation and offers neuroscience a principled route for deciding when waves belong to mechanism and when they constitute a byproduct of underlying coordination"}
