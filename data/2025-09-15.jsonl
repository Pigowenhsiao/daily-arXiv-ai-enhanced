A mathematical model that implements a chromonic\nliquid-crystalline phase and that captures the changes in topology has been\nlacking. We adopt a mathematical model that represents the viral DNA as a pair\nof a vector field and a line. The vector field is a minimizer of the total\nOseen-Frank energy for nematic liquid crystals under chromonic constraints,\nwhile the line is identified with the tangent to the field at selected\nlocations, representing the central axis of the DNA molecule. The fact that the\nOseen-Frank functional assigns infinite energy to topological defects (point\ndefects in two dimensions and line defects in three dimensions) precludes the\npresence of singularities and, in particular, of knot structures. To address\nthis issue, we begin with the optimal vector field and helical line, and\npropose a new algorithm to introduce knots through stochastic perturbations\nassociated with splay and twist deformations, modeled by means of a Langevin\nsystem. We conclude by comparing knot distributions generated by the model and\nby interpreting them in the context of previously published experimental\nresults. Altogether, this work relies on the synergy of modeling, analysis and\ncomputation in the study of viral DNA organization in capsids."}

Recent studies have begun to\ninfer latent HOBC from noninvasive imaging data, but they mainly focus on\nstatic analyses, limiting their applicability in dynamic prediction tasks. To\naddress this gap, we propose DCHO, a unified approach for modeling and\nforecasting the temporal evolution of HOBC based on a Decomposition-Composition\nframework, which is applicable to both non-predictive tasks (state\nclassification) and predictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting). DCHO adopts\na decomposition-composition strategy that reformulates the prediction task into\ntwo manageable subproblems: HOBC inference and latent trajectory prediction. In\nthe inference stage, we propose a dual-view encoder to extract multiscale\ntopological features and a latent combinatorial learner to capture high-level\nHOBC information. In the forecasting stage, we introduce a latent-space\nprediction loss to enhance the modeling of temporal trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that DCHO achieves\nsuperior performance in both non-predictive tasks (state classification) and\npredictive tasks (brain dynamics forecasting), significantly outperforming\nexisting methods."}

Explicitly, our\nmodel is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\\alpha} - \\lfloor\nf_L(x_t)x_t^{-\\alpha} \\rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the\nlogistic map and $ \\lfloor \\ldots \\rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our\ninvestigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters,\n$r$ and $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha < 1$, the system exhibits multiple\nperiod-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased,\ninterspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast,\nfor $1 \\leq \\alpha < 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any\nprior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without\nstability windows. For $\\alpha \\geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The\nspecial case of $\\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a\nclosed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact\nuniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes\nfor $\\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio\n$\\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the\nregime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition\nregime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which\ncorresponds to a Cauchy distribution."}

Efforts on this front have tended to fall into one of two\ncamps. On one side are those who seek to identify a universal cerebellar\ntransform, a single algorithm that can be applied across domains as diverse as\nsensorimotor learning, social cognition, and decision making. On the other side\nare those who focus on functional specializations tailored for different task\ndomains. In this perspective, we propose an integrated approach, one that\nrecognizes functional specialization across different cerebellar subregions,\nbut also builds on common constraints that help define the conditions that\nengage the cerebellum. Drawing on recurring principles from the cerebellum's\nwell-established role in motor control, we identify three core constraints:\nPrediction - the cerebellum performs anticipatory, not reactive, computations;\nTimescale - the cerebellum generates predictions limited to short intervals;\nand Continuity - the cerebellum transforms continuous representations such as\nspace and time. Together, these constraints define the boundary conditions\nunderlying when and how the cerebellum supports cognition, and, just as\nimportantly, specify the types of computations that should not depend on the\ncerebellum."}

Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written\nsummaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly\nrecorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks.

Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a\npercentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or\nomission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,\nomission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced\ninitial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870\npages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).\nQuality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2.
