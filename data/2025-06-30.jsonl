Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in\nthe N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a\nnon-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct\nforms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\\beta$-sheet\nstructure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we\npredict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed\nby core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and\ntheir stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's\nrule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical\npotentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the\ndense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase,\nwhich forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is\nreminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure\nand the simulations show that $\\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early\nduring the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The\ntechniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of\nother IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC."}

We do not have theoretical frameworks that\nallow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent\nbehavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive\ncoevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a\nframework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the\nenergy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional\nnonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from\nequilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical\ndriving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that\nsaves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the\nadaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking\nany global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal\ndissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work\nestablishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose\nstructure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules."}

The author believes that one of the most\nimportant capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the\nability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between\nobjects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our\nstudy, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities\nare proposed. Although the setting for these algorithms is restricted, the\nauthor believes that the case it covers is fundamental. Karl Friston and his\ncolleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain\nactively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is\nproposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of\ninferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse\nproblem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and\nfree-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference\nalgorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating\nprocesses."}

In this process, MutS homologs (MSH)\nplay crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting\ndownstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and\ndiffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while\ntraversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans\nDNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing\na mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding\nclamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the\nsliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the\ndiffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle\ntracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling\nframework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the\ndiffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion\nmechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct\ndiffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These\nstates alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly\ninvolving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest\nand the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics\nreflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp,\nhighlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated."}

M1 is organized\nin a somatotopic manner, such that M1 output driving movement to different\nparts of the body is organized along the cortical surface. In primates, the arm\nand hand are represented in M1 as separate but overlapping territories. Unit\nactivity recorded from the M1 forelimb representation comodulates with\nparameters related to reaching and/or grasping. The overall aim of this\ndissertation is to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of M1 activity that\nproduces reach-to-grasp movements. To address this goal, intracortical\nmicrostimulation (ICMS) is delivered along the precentral gyrus of two macaque\nmonkeys to define the M1 motor map. Subsequently, cortical activity is recorded\nfrom the M1 forelimb representation using intrinsic signal optical imaging\n(ISOI) while macaques execute an instructed reach-to-grasp task. Results from\nimaging experiments produce spatial maps that define cortical territories with\nincreased activity during reach-to-grasp movements. Next, unit activity was\nrecorded from the M1 forelimb representation with a laminar multielectrode\nwhile macaques completed the same reach-to-grasp task. Recording site locations\ndiffered between sessions to comprehensively sample unit responses throughout\nthe M1 forelimb representation. Imaging experiments reveal that activity\nsupporting reach-to-grasp movements was concentrated in patches that comprise\nless than half of the M1 forelimb representation. Electrophysiology recordings\nreveal that activity related to reaching is spatially organized within M1\ndistinctly from activity related to grasping. The results support the idea that\nspatial organizing principles are inherent in M1 activity that supports\nreach-to-grasp movements."}

While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying\nprocesses, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under\nenvironmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a\nminimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas.\nWe incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing\nwith trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that\nthese mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna\nand grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns\nconsisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental\nconditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the\nmodel predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a\nphenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel\n''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives\ntipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included.\nThese transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem\ntransitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical\nand empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent\ntipping or drive collapse."}
