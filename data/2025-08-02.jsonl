To understand issues with these\ncomplex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of\nLLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning.\nMaterials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs\n(DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both\nwith and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and\nunfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt\nmodifications, both errors were present across all models although more\nresponses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For\nexperiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a\nreasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to\nMistral and Phi.
