In this work, we did not account for the energy\nsupplied/injected due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme\nitself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum\nmechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be\nexpected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several\norders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature,\nand that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically\ntotally non-existent. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (100-650\nrevolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude\nbelow the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the\nc-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size\nof the c-ring (17 to 8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy\nlevel of the c-ring).

This work\npresents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed\nthroughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the\nsystem), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the\nstipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for\npathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which\ndecomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a\nnon-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the\nongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway.\nApplying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response\nregime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added\nthat support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the\nrestriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded\nbelow by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from\nequilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more\nrestricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be\nfound that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at\nfar-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a\nnetwork at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have\nimplications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms\nmay first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis,\nbut later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention,\nand more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput."}

While prior\nwork has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy\n(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are\noften task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to\nnew procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable\ntransformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals\nfor cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised\nlearning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation\n(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all\ntasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It\ngeneralizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer\nthan 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter\nmodule, attaining an AUC greater than 87%.

Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing\nthese challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree\nbranch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical\nrelationships.

Conceptually,\nstochasticity and heterogeneity are often modeled as branching processes or as\npercolation on contact networks. Mathematically, probability generating\nfunctions provide a flexible and efficient tool to describe these models and\nquickly produce forecasts. While their predictions are probabilistic-i.e.,\ndistributions of outcome-they depend deterministically on the input\ndistribution of transmission statistics and/or contact structure. Since these\ninputs can be noisy data or models of high dimension, traditional sensitivity\nanalyses are computationally prohibitive and are therefore rarely used. Here,\nwe use statistical condition estimation to measure the sensitivity of\nstochastic polynomials representing noisy generating functions. In doing so, we\ncan separate the stochasticity of their forecasts from potential noise in their\ninput. For standard epidemic models, we find that predictions are most\nsensitive at the critical epidemic threshold (basic reproduction number $R_0 =\n1$) only if the transmission is sufficiently homogeneous (dispersion parameter\n$k > 0.3$).
