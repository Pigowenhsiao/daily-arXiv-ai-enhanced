We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that\npredicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.\nBy casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt\nestimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal\nanisotropy as $3 \\times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and\n(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across\nresidues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in\npredicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable\nreconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.\nNotably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior\nmethods.

Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency.

This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the\nsensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand\nconcentrations.

We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell,\nand find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of\nconcentrations.

Here, a 'mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of\nsize spectra' (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of\navailable data, literature and models result in the conclusion that most\npelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as\nresource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key\nrole of the maximum carrying capacity of large-sized organisms.

In this study, we investigate the relationship\nbetween consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG\nrecordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness,\nanesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN)\nmodel, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response\nfunction as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the\namplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical\nindicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response\nfunction in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous\ntheoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the\ntransition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a\npotential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics.\nEmpirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong,\nwidely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under\nanesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network\ndynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity.\nDuring recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the\ngradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the\nrestoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust,\nbrain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical\ncondition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying\nlevels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain."}

Here we highlight some of the challenges that remain to be addressed\nto understand retinal processing of natural stimuli and describe emerging\nresearch avenues to overcome them.\n  A key issue is model complexity. When complexifying the probing stimuli\ntowards natural stimuli, the number of parameters required in models of retinal\ncomputations increases, raising issues of overfitting, generalization, and\ninterpretability. This increase in complexity is also a challenge for normative\napproaches as it makes it difficult to derive non-linear retinal computations\nfrom simple principles.\n  We describe two types of approaches that may help circumvent this issue in\nthe future. First, we propose that a new form of reductionism is emerging:\ninstead of breaking down natural stimuli into sums of simpler stimuli, it\nbecomes possible to 'divide and conquer' natural scenes into different visual\ninputs corresponding to different visual tasks, in order to study retinal\ncomputations separately for each of these visual tasks. Second, several studies\nsuggest that it will soon be possible to mitigate the issue of complexity, by\n'embodying' the models with more biological constraints, in particularly those\nderived from connectomic studies.

Here, we introduce a model in which we assume\nbacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that\neither enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through\nlarge-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate\nthe emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing\nthe density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully\nmixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial\nclusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species,\nthis transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the\nmotility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and\ninteraction densities constant.

With a focus on pragmatic\nconsiderations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and\nthe current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental\nin understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems\nand scales."}

However, the traditional bootstrapped\namplitude difference (BAD) method struggles to accurately differentiate\ndeceptive individuals from innocent ones when irrelevant stimuli carry\nfamiliarity or inherent meaning, thus limiting its practical applicability in\nreal-world investigations. This study aimed to enhance the deception detection\ncapability of the P300-based CIT, particularly under conditions of low stimulus\nheterogeneity. To closely simulate realistic investigative scenarios, we\ndesigned a realistic mock-crime setup in which participants were familiarized\nwith all CIT stimuli except the target stimulus. EEG data acquired during CIT\nsessions were analyzed using the BAD method, machine learning algorithms, and\ndeep learning (DL) methods (ShallowNet and EEGNet). Among these techniques,\nEEGNet demonstrated the highest deception detection accuracy at 86.67%, when\nemploying our proposed data augmentation approach. Overall, DL methods could\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of deception detection under challenging\nconditions of low stimulus heterogeneity by effectively capturing subtle\ncognitive responses not accessible through handcrafted features.

How these properties evolve is not well understood because\nthey emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are\nusually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a\ngame-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the\ncoevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and\nnorm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and\npreferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a\nproliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal\nproperties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can\nsimultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the\ndegree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and\nreduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the\nextent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of\nsocial homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a\npopulation fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different\ncharacteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to\ncooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences\nfor conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have\nimplications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and\ncollective action in times of crisis."}

Their ability to generate\nhigh-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other\ncomplex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse\nand unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,\nwe observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the\nmajority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing\napproaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we\nintroduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale\n$\\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these\ndata-dependent $\\sigma$ values.

One of the major challenges hindering the real-world\ndeployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence\nof motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact\nremoval rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace\nReconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without\nincorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion.

This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial\nlearning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how\nthe decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as\n$1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the\nlocalized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they\nare linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance\nexponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where\nwell localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed\nwith intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,\nfor a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the\nfastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence\nforgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning\nand to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence\non the benefits of forgetting."}
