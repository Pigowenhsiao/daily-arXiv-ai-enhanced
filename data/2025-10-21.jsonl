In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using\ngeneral-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring\nlabeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the\nmolecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs\na one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical\nlabels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this\nposition-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class\nexamples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to\nsingle-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.\nAcross academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our\nwork enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically\nplausible reaction sites ($\\geq90\\%$), named reaction classes ($\\geq40\\%$), and\nfinal reactants ($\\geq74\\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work\nalso provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by\nmapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing\ndata scarcity."}

This\nchallenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and\nthe high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of\nconventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label\nmultimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine\ngenetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk\nstratification.
