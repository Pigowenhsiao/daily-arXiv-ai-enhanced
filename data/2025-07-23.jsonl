In the\ncase of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have\ncontrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions\nbetween oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing\nthe driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions\nbetween nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by\nadded salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay,\nwe combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model\nsolution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a\nfunction of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition.\nDespite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base\npairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and\ntemperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various\nconditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase\nseparation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of\nnonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long\ntimescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and\nbase pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition\nvarious NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate\nhow the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the\ncomplexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of\ninteraction."}

To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six\ninterpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features,\nspeech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features,\nand contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper,\nHuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by\neach feature class.

Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously\nunresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural\nalignment: 1.

Using these events, they control various targets\nsuch as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in\nconnected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as\ncontrollers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events\ndirectly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging\nas it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical\ntractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering\nthe spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking\nneural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal,\nnecessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we\ncircumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method\nfor task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we\ntake inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define\na spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system\ncloser to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity\nfor an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems.

Such a system modulates the network's activity by\nmatching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire\nnetwork. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise\nrobustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification\ntasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that\ncombines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling\nneuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that\nthe brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of\nneurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the\nsame object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We\ndrew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all\nlayers of a convolutional network.
