Pyk2 is primarily expressed in neurons where it\nis involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic functions. Although\nprevious studies have implicated Pyk2 in amyloid-$\\beta$ and Tau pathologies of\nAlzheimer's disease, its exact role remains unresolved, with evidence showing\nboth detrimental and protective effects in mouse models. Here, we investigate\nthe role of Pyk2 in hippocampal hyperactivity, Tau phosphorylation and synaptic\nloss associated with Alzheimer's disease-related alterations occurring in the\nearly stages of the disease. Methods: Pyk2's involvement in amyloid-$\\beta$\noligomer-induced hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity was investigated using\nwhole cell patch-clamp in hippocampal slices from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Various\nPyk2 mutants were overexpressed in cultured cortical neurons to study Pyk2's\nrole in synaptic loss. Pyk2 and Tau interaction was assessed with bimolecular\nfluorescence complementation assays in cultured neurons and\nco-immunoprecipitation in mouse cortex. Pyk2's ability to directly\nphosphorylate Tau was determined using in vitro kinase assays. To evaluate the\nimpact of Pyk2 on Tau expression and phosphorylation in synapses, cellular\nfractionation was performed on hippocampi from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Results:\nGenetic deletion of Pyk2 prevented amyloid-$\\beta$ oligomer-induced hippocampal\nneuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss. Overexpression of Pyk2 in neurons\ndecreased dendritic spine density independently of its autophosphorylation or\nkinase activity, but through its proline-rich motif 1. Furthermore, Pyk2\ninteracted with Tau in synapses and directly phosphorylated it at Tyr18 in\nvitro, while Pyk2 deletion decreased Tau phosphorylation at Thr181 and its\nsynaptic localization in the hippocampus. Conclusions: Pyk2 contributes to\nhippocampal neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss, two early events in\nAlzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It is also involved in Tau synaptic\nlocalization and phosphorylation, processes known to be detrimental in\nAlzheimer's disease. These findings highlight Pyk2 as a critical player in\nAlzheimer's disease pathophysiology and suggest its potential as a promising\ntherapeutic target for early intervention."}

Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among\ndonors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid,\nbenchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells\n(RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about\nthe association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and\ntransfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to\nevaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age,\nlifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage\nand transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides\nopportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation\nof storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a\nnew platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site\nevaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a\nmarker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible\nmethodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define\nunique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of\nthe six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides\nassociated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the\nstored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion\nefficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by\ndisrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI.\nTogether, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a\npoint-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine."}

In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which\nepineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb\nnerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously\nidentified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked\nelectromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle\nrecruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation\npatterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves\nwere harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular\norganization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the\ncombined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one\nanimal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by\nlinking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately\ncontributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic\napplications."}
