Polarized microtubule arrays are key\nto facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules\nalso undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the\nfilaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent\nmicrotubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and\nnew filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain\ntheir biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their\npolarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton\norganization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of\nmicrotubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could\ngenerate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time\nMarkov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize\ntwo experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where\nthe direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a\ncheckpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite\nto the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these\nvalidated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback\nis sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths,\nand that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is robust in spite of\nstochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the\nrelationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to\ngive insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament\narrays in other biological settings."}

Understanding the environmental\ncontrols on their distribution is essential for predicting the impacts of land\nuse and climate change on soil ecosystems. While local studies have identified\nabiotic drivers of earthworm communities, broad-scale spatial patterns remain\nunderexplored.\n  We developed a multi-species, multi-task deep learning model to jointly\npredict the distribution of 77 earthworm species across metropolitan France,\nusing historical (1960-1970) and contemporary (1990-2020) records. The model\nintegrates climate, soil, and land cover variables to estimate habitat\nsuitability. We applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key\nenvironmental drivers and used species clustering to reveal ecological response\ngroups.\n  The joint model achieved high predictive performance (TSS >= 0.7) and\nimproved predictions for rare species compared to traditional species\ndistribution models. Shared feature extraction across species allowed for more\nrobust identification of common and contrasting environmental responses.\nPrecipitation variability, temperature seasonality, and land cover emerged as\ndominant predictors of earthworm distribution. Species clustering revealed\ndistinct ecological strategies tied to climatic and land use gradients.\n  Our study advances both the methodological and ecological understanding of\nsoil biodiversity. We demonstrate the utility of interpretable deep learning\napproaches for large-scale soil fauna modeling and provide new insights into\nearthworm habitat specialization. These findings support improved soil\nbiodiversity monitoring and conservation planning in the face of global\nenvironmental change."}

To meet the growing demand for detailed and\naccurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS\nhabitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and\nuncertainty analyses.\n  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution\nsatellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic\nvariables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable\nEUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide\ninformation on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3\nwithin each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for\nboth conservation and restoration purposes.\n  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block\ncross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests\nonly), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive\nperformances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of\nrecall and precision across habitat formations."}
