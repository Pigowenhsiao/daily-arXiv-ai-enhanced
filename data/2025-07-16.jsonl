Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry\nwith two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract\nQuantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN).

In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV\ntransmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains,\ndiagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line\ntherapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both\nstrains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a\ndisease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may\nbe eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists.
