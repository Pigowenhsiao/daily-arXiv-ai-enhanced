The strength of an interaction, typically given by\nthe dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must\nbe monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal\nmethod for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large\nrange of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require\nlabeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity\nof the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but\ntypically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass\nsignals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to\noverlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of\neach oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.\nFollowing this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead\nIon Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the\naffinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of\nTryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei\nparasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,\nqLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as\nisothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein\nhomodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the\ngradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface\ncontacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and\ncost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can\naccelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening\nfor proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and\nmolecular glues."}

Classical demographic theory predicts that volatility in growth should\ndecline rapidly with size due to the averaging effects of the law of large\nnumbers. As such, while small-scale societies may be demographically fragile,\nlarge-scale societies should be much more stable. Using a large census dataset\nof 228 indigenous societies from Brazil, we show that this prediction does not\nhold. Instead of volatility declining as the square root of population size, it\nfalls much more slowly. This means that individuals within communities do not\nbehave as independent demographic units as their lives are correlated through\ncooperation, shared subsistence practices, overlapping land use, and exposure\nto common shocks such as disease outbreaks or failed harvests. These\ncorrelations build demographic synchrony, drastically reducing the effective\ndemographic degrees of freedom in a population, keeping volatility higher than\nexpected at all scales. As a result, large-scale populations fluctuate as if\nthey were much smaller, increasing their vulnerability to collapse. This helps\nexplain why human societies of all sizes seem vulnerable to collapse, and why\nthe archaeological and historical record is filled with examples of large,\ncomplex societies collapsing despite their size. We suggest demographic\nsynchrony provides a general mechanism for understanding why human populations\nremain vulnerable across all scales: Scale still stabilizes synchronous\npopulations via density increases, but synchrony ensures that stability grows\nonly slowly with size, leaving large populations more volatile, and more\nvulnerable, than classical demographic theory predicts."}

However, conventional\nencoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel\nresponses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards\nanatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.\nWe introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI\nactivity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat\nvector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit\nfunction: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI\nspace, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation\ndecouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary\nspatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the\nmodel in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:\n(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;\nmodeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data\nefficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data\nacross individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned\non new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both\nintrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance\nwhile reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge,\nNRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened\nvoxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D\nspace."}

Beyond\nbenchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling\ncomparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues.\nWe observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and\nfunctional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node,\nand uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune\ninfiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work\ndefines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and\nestablishes a reference resource for the ST community."}

The strength of an interaction, typically given by\nthe dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must\nbe monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal\nmethod for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large\nrange of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require\nlabeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity\nof the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but\ntypically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass\nsignals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to\noverlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of\neach oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.\nFollowing this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead\nIon Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the\naffinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of\nTryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei\nparasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,\nqLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as\nisothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein\nhomodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the\ngradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface\ncontacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and\ncost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can\naccelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening\nfor proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and\nmolecular glues."}

The question of internal mechanisms\nthat modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is\nestablished that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One\nmechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing\nfeedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An\nalternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which\nare positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both\nadaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal\npopulations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable\ndifferences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a\nspatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial\ncoupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two\nadaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and\ninclude the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength\nand gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent\nunder a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength,\nleading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation\nstructure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves.\nAdditionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal\nactivity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of\nthe traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though\nbeing dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent\nvariations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of\ntraveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms."}
