We then applied the SAR (Spatial Autoregressive) model with the listed\nvariables and tested four spatial weight structures (Queen, Rook, KNN, Distance\nBand). The best-performing model was SAR with Rook contiguity, yielding a\npseudo-R-squared of 0.6864 and a spatial pseudo-R-squared of 0.6934. Five\nvariables showed p-values below 0.05.

In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local\ndynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between\nenvironments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across\nmultiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models\ncommonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in\nwhich local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single\nparameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between\nthose environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic\nenvironmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the\nmicrobiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with\neach other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time\nintervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such\ndiscrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the\ninteraction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange\nduring each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our\nframework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those\nregimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an\nillustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling\nframework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the\ndynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on\nthe interplay between interaction frequency and strength."}

Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme.
