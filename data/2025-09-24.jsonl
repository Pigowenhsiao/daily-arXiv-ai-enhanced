Protein\nfunction is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein\n(allosteric regulation).

However, it is not yet fully understood how\nbinding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at\nanother distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery\nin 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein\ninteractions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the\ndiscrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the\nconcept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum\nchemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the\ndefinition of interactions.

Analysis of the publicly available\nEye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover\ncanonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta:\n4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both\nP3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise\ninterval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four\ndifferent choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus\nphases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise\ninterval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems.\nWhile validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step\ntowards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting\nneurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system\noptimization."}

The\nneural mechanisms supporting these experiences remain poorly understood. This\nstudy examined brain activity associated with a self-induced, substance-free\nNOC known as Auto-Induced Cognitive Trance (AICT). Twenty-seven trained\nparticipants underwent high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings\nduring rest and AICT. We analyzed the aperiodic component of the power spectrum\n(1/f), Lempel-Ziv complexity, and sample entropy from five-minute signal\nsegments. A machine learning approach was used to classify rest and AICT,\nidentify discriminative features, and localize their sources. We also compared\nEEG metrics across conditions and assessed whether baseline activity predicted\nthe magnitude of change during AICT. Classification analyses revealed\ncondition-specific differences in spectral exponents, complexity, and entropy.\nThe aperiodic component showed the strongest discriminative power, followed by\nentropy and complexity. Source localization highlighted frontal regions, the\nposterior cingulate cortex, and the left parietal cortex as key contributors to\nthe AICT state. Baseline neural activity in frontal and parietal regions\npredicted individual variability in the transition from rest to AICT. These\nfindings indicate that AICT engages brain regions implicated in rich subjective\nexperiences and provide mechanistic insights into how self-induced trance\nstates influence neural functioning."}

Code is available at GitHub\n  https://github.com/ShanechiLab/PGPCA.git", "summary": "Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science\nincluding neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a\nprominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic\napproach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection\nbetween PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its\nextensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in\na Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data\nmay be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than\nlying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal\nComponent Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction\nalgorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear\nmanifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition\nto the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be\nderived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold\nand noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA\nmodel parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data\ndistributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations\nand brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data\ndistribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.\nMoreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric\ncoordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,\nPGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both\naround and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for\nenhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear\nmanifold."}
