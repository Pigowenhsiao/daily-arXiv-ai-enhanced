While the\nidea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more\nthan 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful\npredictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still\nlack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two\nmain conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the\nfunnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a\nrugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes\na hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two\nfronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful\nexperimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and\nhydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the\nfolding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational\nbreakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized\nstatic structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning\ntoward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the\nfirst time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold,\nand how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine."}

A common assumption is that, under timescale\nseparation, estimates for the coherence and MI rate obtained from simplified\n(reduced) models closely approximate those in the underlying full models.

We\nconsider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the\ninternal nodes compatible the tree graph. Recent work has established an\nelegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called\n\\textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for\nisochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time,\nsuch as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals.\nAnother important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of\nevents is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree,\ncalled a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods.\nThese trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B\ncells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a\nfully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total\norder.\n  Here we extend the \\textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous\nranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of\n\\textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix\nrepresentation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly\nconstrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of\nall valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic\nmodels on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial\nobjects that have a rich history in the literature: isochronous ranked tree\nshapes are related to alternating permutations that Andr\\'e studied over 130\nyears ago, and Poupard found (nearly 40 years ago) that fully heterochronous\nranked tree shapes are counted by the reduced tangent numbers."}

From prior experience, neurons\nlearn coherent sets-regions of stimulus state space whose trajectories evolve\ncohesively over finite times-and assign membership indices to new stimuli.\nCoherent sets are identified via spectral clustering of the stochastic Koopman\noperator (SKO), where the sign pattern of a subdominant singular function\npartitions the state space into minimally coupled regions. For multivariate\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes, this singular function reduces to a linear\nprojection onto the dominant singular vector of the whitened state-transition\nmatrix. Encoding this singular vector as a receptive field enables neurons to\ncompute membership indices via the projection sign in a biologically plausible\nmanner. Each neuron detects either a predictive coherent set (stimuli with\ncommon futures) or a retrospective coherent set (stimuli with common pasts),\nsuggesting a functional dichotomy among neurons. Since neurons lack access to\nexplicit dynamical equations, the requisite singular vectors must be estimated\ndirectly from data, for example, via past-future canonical correlation analysis\non lag-vector representations-an approach that naturally extends to nonlinear\ndynamics. This framework provides a novel account of neuronal temporal\nfiltering, the ubiquity of rectification in neural responses, and known\nfunctional dichotomies. Coherent-set clustering thus emerges as a fundamental\ncomputation underlying sensory processing and transferable to bio-inspired\nartificial systems."}
