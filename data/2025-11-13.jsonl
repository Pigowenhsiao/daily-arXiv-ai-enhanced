We present Bio AI Agent, a multi-agent artificial intelligence system powered by large language models that enables autonomous CAR-T development through collaborative specialized agents. The system comprises six autonomous agents: Target Selection Agent for multi-parametric antigen prioritization across >10,000 cancer-associated targets, Toxicity Prediction Agent for comprehensive safety profiling integrating tissue expression atlases and pharmacovigilance databases, Molecular Design Agent for rational CAR engineering, Patent Intelligence Agent for freedom-to-operate analysis, Clinical Translation Agent for regulatory compliance, and Decision Orchestration Agent for multi-agent coordination. Retrospective validation demonstrated autonomous identification of high-risk targets including FcRH5 (hepatotoxicity) and CD229 (off-tumor toxicity), patent infringement risks for CD38+SLAMF7 combinations, and generation of comprehensive development roadmaps. By enabling parallel processing, specialized reasoning, and autonomous decision-making superior to monolithic AI systems, Bio AI Agent addresses critical gaps in precision oncology development and has potential to accelerate translation of next-generation immunotherapies from discovery to clinic."}

Standardisation is required to enable consistent large-scale analysis. The OMOP-CDM, developed by the OHDSI community, provides one widely adopted standard. Our framework achieves schema-agnostic transformation by extending upon existing literature in using human-readable YAML specification to support both relational (Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)) and document-based (MongoDB) data sources. It also incorporates critical production readiness features: provenance-aware mapping and support for incremental updates. We validated the pipeline using 2.7 million patient records and 27 million encounters across six hospitals spanning two decades of records. The resulting OMOP-CDM dataset demonstrated an acceptable level of data quality with a 97% overall passing rate based on the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard check. Our work provides a reusable blueprint for large-scale data harmonisation, directly supporting real-world medical data research."}

Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have shown their capability for the accurate prediction of drug repositioning. However, implementing DL-based modeling requires in-depth domain knowledge and proficient programming skills. Results: In this application, we introduce DeepDR, the first integrated platform that combines a variety of established DL-based models for disease- and target-specific drug repositioning tasks. DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Additionally, the recommended results include detailed descriptions of the recommended drugs and visualize key patterns with interpretability through a knowledge graph. Conclusion: DeepDR is free and open to all users without the requirement of registration. We believe it can provide an easy-to-use, systematic, highly accurate, and computationally automated platform for both experimental and computational scientists."}

However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions."}

We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development."}

The formation of these nanoclusters is highly dependent on a series of post-translational modifications, such as mono-and multi-phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues. We theoretically simulate how a protein can be either mono-or multi-phosphorylated on several residues in functional nanoclusters, depending on effective biophysical parameters (diffusion, dwell time, etc.). Moving beyond a binary view of phosphorylation, this approach highlights the interplay between mono-and multi-phosphorylation, the cooperative effects generally associated with multi-phosphorylation networks, and stresses the role of phosphatases in transforming graded phosphorylation signals into almost switch-like responses. The results are discussed in light of experiments that probe the distribution of phospho-residues."}

In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states."}

The model can be equivalently viewed as a nonlinear renewal equation for the incidence of infection or as a partial differential equation for the density of infected individuals. We explicitly consider gamma, rather than Erlang, distributed durations of infection using a combination of ODE approximations and numerical bifurcation methods. We show that the shape of this distribution strongly influences stability of the endemic equilibrium, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the mean duration of infectiousness are fixed. Moreover, we establish the existence of regions of bistability, where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic orbit. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of bistability in infection-age structured models with waning immunity alone. Finally, we show how common compartmental modelling approaches, which impose implicit assumptions on the distribution of the duration of infection, can lead to spurious dynamical outcomes. Taken together, our analysis underscores the crucial role of distributional structure in epidemic modelling and provides new insights into the rich dynamics of infection-age structured SIS/SIRS models."}

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation."}

Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Together, these findings show that the thermoinformational framework yields compact, physically grounded descriptors that hold in both human and mouse datasets studied here."}

Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries.
