An animal is\nassumed to transition between behavioural states through time, as described by\ntransition probabilities. Within each state, the movement typically follows a\ndiscrete-time random walk, where steps between successive observed locations\nare described in terms of step lengths (related to speed) and turning angles\n(related to tortuosity). HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their\noutputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known\ntheoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated\nrandom walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement.\nWe also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of\nbiological scenarios. The scale dependence affects not only all model\nparameters, i.e., the transition probabilities and the movement parameters\nwithin each behavioural state, but also the overall classification of movement\npatterns into states. This highlights the importance of carefully considering\nthe time resolution when drawing conclusions from the results of analysis. In\naddition, scale dependence generally precludes the analysis of tracking data\ncollected at irregular time intervals, and the comparison (or combination) of\ndata sets with different sampling rates. HMMs remain a valuable tool to answer\nquestions about animal movement and behaviour, as long as these limitations are\nwell understood."}

There it was shown that when a\ndomination relationship exists between a pair of vertices in a graph, certain\nfixed points in the corresponding CTLN can be ruled out. Here we prove two new\ntheorems about graphical domination, and show that they apply to a\nsignificantly more general class of recurrent networks called generalized CTLNs\n(gCTLNs). Theorem 1 establishes that if a dominated node is removed from a\nnetwork, the reduced network has exactly the same fixed points. Theorem 2 tells\nus that by iteratively removing dominated nodes from an initial graph $G$, the\nfinal (irreducible) graph $\\widetilde{G}$ is unique. We also introduce another\nnew family of TLNs, called E-I TLNs, consisting of $n$ excitatory nodes and a\nsingle inhibitory node providing global inhibition. We provide a concrete\nmapping between the parameters of gCTLNs and E-I TLNs built from the same graph\nsuch that corresponding networks have the same fixed points. We also show that\nTheorems 1 and 2 apply equally well to E-I TLNs, and that the dynamics of\ngCTLNs and E-I TLNs with the same underlying graph $G$ exhibit similar behavior\nthat is well predicted by the fixed points of the reduced graph\n$\\widetilde{G}$."}

The study is based on the\nanalysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional\nstates of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem\nof class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.\nTo solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with\nan attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative\nfor emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is\ntrained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with\nsubsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training\nstage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although\nthe degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are\nworse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an\nincrease in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates\nthe promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the\nsearch for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed\nmethod can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in\ntasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution."}

To address this, disentanglement techniques have been\nintegrated into discrete neural audio codecs to impose structure on the\nextracted tokens.

While classical\ninterpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent\nfindings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves\nto access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis\nto explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we\nassessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed\nimagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups\nshowed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected\ninfluence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs\nshowed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures\nunder different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these\nresults indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.\nOverall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated\nrepresentations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like\nimagination in artificial intelligence."}

Additionally, we investigate key characteristics of\nthe collected resting-state and sleep data, in order to determine the privacy\nrisks involved with openly available EEG data. We used Google Scholar, Web of\nScience and searched relevant journals to find studies which classified or\ndetected the presence of various disorders and personal information in resting\nstate and sleep EEG. Only English full-text peer-reviewed journal articles or\nconference papers about classifying the presence of medical disorders between\nindividuals were included. A quality analysis carried out by 3 reviewers\ndetermined general paper quality based on specified evaluation criteria. In\nresting state EEG, various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder,\nParkinson's disease, and alcohol use disorder have been classified with high\nclassification accuracy, often requiring only 5 mins of data or less. Sleep EEG\ntends to hold classifiable information about sleep disorders such as sleep\napnea, insomnia, and REM sleep disorder, but usually involve longer recordings\nor data from multiple sleep stages. Many classification methods are still\ndeveloping but even today, access to a person's EEG can reveal sensitive\npersonal health information. With an increasing ability of machine learning\nmethods to re-identify individuals from their EEG data, this review\ndemonstrates the importance of anonymization, and the development of improved\ntools for keeping study participants and medical EEG users' privacy safe."}
