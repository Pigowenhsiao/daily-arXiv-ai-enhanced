However, existing methods often fail to capture\nsolvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn\nmultiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a\npre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated\nunder diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the\nmodel to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a\nunified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to\ncapture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial\nrelationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular\nrepresentations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,\nincluding a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on\nthe PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%\nin virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling\nand produces consistent results across benchmarks.

The sample entropy and\nthe Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well\nknown that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system\ntowards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity\nof a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when\nthe membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic\nequilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values\nobtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium\nstate of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods\nwere proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium\npotential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy\nvalues were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions.\nThese refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map.\nAdditionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents.

Here, we\ncomputationally explore the effect of two different inhibitory connectivity\nmotifs on the retina's response to moving objects: feed-forward and recurrent\nfeed-back inhibition. We show that both can account for motion anticipation\nwith two different mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition truncates motion\nresponses and shifts peak responses forward via subtractive inhibition, whereas\nrecurrent feedback coupling evokes, via divisive inhibition, excitatory and\ninhibitory waves with different phases that add up and shift the response peak.\nA key difference between the two mechanisms is how the peak response scales\nwith the speed of a moving object.

CITS models neural dynamics using a\nstructural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged\nconditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics.\nUnlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models\nand Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and\nno temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially\nnon-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures.

In the auditory domain, attention\nenables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be\neither attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed\ntowards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these\nmodes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct\nremains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural\ncorrelates of different attentional modes in a controlled \"cocktail party\"\nparadigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a\nspatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene\n(global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in\nthe scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more\nperceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore,\nobject-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and\nare differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up\nsalience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a\nreduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated.\nIn addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a\nsource-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the\nobject or spatial modes.
