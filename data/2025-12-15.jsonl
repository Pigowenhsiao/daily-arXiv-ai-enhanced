Such systems are modeled by PDE ODE couplings that combine three dimensional diffusion with nonlinear intracellular dynamics, making analysis and simulation challenging. We show that the diffusion dynamics converges exponentially to a quasi steady spatial profile and use singular perturbation theory to reduce the model to a finite dimensional multiagent network. A closed form communication matrix derived from the spherical Green's function captures the effective sender receiver coupling. Numerical results show the reduced model closely matches the full dynamics while enabling scalable simulation of large cell populations."}

However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process."}

Although many theories link consciousness to rich, multiscale, and flexible neural organisation, robust quantitative measures are still lacking. This paper presents a theory-neutral framework that characterises consciousness-related dynamics through three properties: hierarchical integration (H), cross-frequency complexity (D), and metastability (M). Candidate subsystems are identified using predictive information, temporal complexity, and state-space exploration to distinguish structured from unstructured activity. We provide mathematical definitions for all components and implement the framework in a generative model of synthetic EEG, simulating nine brain states ranging from psychedelic and wakeful to dreaming, non-REM sleep, minimally conscious, anaesthetised, and seizure-like regimes. Across single trials and Monte Carlo ensembles, the composite index reliably separates high-consciousness from impaired or non-conscious states. We further validate the framework using real EEG from the Sleep-EDF dataset alongside matched synthetic EEG designed to reproduce state-dependent oscillatory structure. Across Wake, N2, and REM sleep, synthetic data recapitulate the empirical ordering and magnitude of the index, indicating that the index captures stable and biologically meaningful distinctions. This approach provides a principled and empirically grounded tool for quantifying consciousness-related neural organisation with potential applications to both biological and artificial systems."}

A key step in the analysis of such models is to identify equilibria and find conditions for their stability. Local stability analysis reduces to a problem in linear algebra, but there is no general algorithm for establishing global stability properties. Substantial progress on global stability of epidemic models has been made in the last 20 years, primarily by successfully applying Lyapunov's method to specific systems. Here, we show that any compartmental epidemic model in which susceptible individuals cannot be distinguished and can be infected only once, has a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) equilibrium. If the basic reproduction number ${R}_0$ satisfies ${R}_0 > 1$, then the GAS fixed point is an endemic equilibrium (i.e., constant, positive disease prevalence). Alternatively, if ${R}_0 \\le 1$, then the GAS equilibrium is disease-free. This theorem subsumes a large number of results published over the last century, strengthens most of them by establishing global rather than local stability, avoids the need for any stability analyses of these systems in the future, and settles the question of whether co-existing stable solutions or non-equilibrium attractors are possible in such models: they are not."}

Accurately estimating hive populations is essential for understanding the effects of environmental factors on bee colonies, yet traditional methods of counting bees are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, particularly in large-scale studies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based solution for automating bee population counting using CSRNet and introduce ASUBEE, the FIRST high-resolution dataset specifically designed for this task. Our method employs density map estimation to predict bee populations, effectively addressing challenges such as occlusion and overlapping bees that are common in hive monitoring. We demonstrate that CSRNet achieves superior performance in terms of time efficiency, with a computation time of just 1 second per image, while delivering accurate counts even in complex and densely populated hive scenarios. Our findings show that deep learning approaches like CSRNet can dramatically enhance the efficiency of hive population assessments, providing a valuable tool for researchers and beekeepers alike. This work marks a significant advancement in applying AI technologies to ecological research, offering scalable and precise monitoring solutions for honey bee populations."}

Classical computational theories, built around vector-space transformations and instantaneous error minimization, struggle to reconcile the slow timescale of synaptic plasticity with the fast timescale of perceptual synthesis. We propose a unifying framework based on algebraic topology, the Homological Brain, in which neural computation is understood as the construction and navigation of topological structure. Central to this view is the Parity Principle, a homological partition between even-dimensional scaffolds encoding stable content ($Φ$) and odd-dimensional flows encoding dynamic context ($Ψ$). Transient contextual flows are resolved through a three-stage topological trinity transformation: Search (open-chain exploration), Closure (topological cycle formation), and Condensation (collapse of validated flows into new scaffold). This process converts high-complexity recursive search (formally modeled by Savitch's Theorem in NPSPACE) into low-complexity navigation over a learned manifold (analogous to memoized Dynamic Programming in P). In this framework, topological condensation is the mechanism that transforms a ``search problem'' into a ``navigation task'', allowing the brain to amortize past inference and achieve rapid perceptual integration. This perspective unifies the Wake-Sleep cycle, episodic-to-semantic consolidation, and dual-process theories (System 1-vs-System 2), revealing the brain as a homology engine that minimizes topological complexity to transmute high-entropy sensory flux into low-entropy, invariant cognitive structure."}

We propose a new model that places the root of the life homochirality in the formation of protocellular bilayer vesicles (liposomes). These liposomes are formed at the water/air interface from Langmuir layers and contain ribose, which is known to be delivered by carbonaceous meteorites; hence, the model suggests that impact craters are likely loci of life origin. The ribose delivered by meteorites appeared as racemic, yet life is based on D-ribose and its derivatives. The high membrane permeability to D-ribose implies a strong interaction with the charged phosphate head groups of the bilayer membrane. Such interaction, along with the presence of Fe3+, leads to ribose phosphorylation, forming ribose-5-phosphate, a molecule that cannot cross the membrane. As a result, the D-ribose-5-phosphate formed inside the vesicle becomes trapped and cannot escape. Over time, the phosphorylated D-ribose accumulates inside vesicles, forming a population of D-ribose-5-phosphate vesicles. Following the selective accumulation of phosphorylated D-ribose, D-oxyribose-5-phosphate forms, facilitating the transition of entrapped D-ribose-5-phosphate molecules into complex functional molecules, such as ribozymes/RNA, and over time, into DNA. The proposed model can be tested experimentally."}

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to improve their reasoning abilities. Drawing inspiration from the interplay between neural processes and human cognition, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the roles and behaviors of attention heads, which are key components of LLMs. We introduce CogQA, a dataset that decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions with a chain-of-thought design, each associated with specific cognitive functions such as retrieval or logical reasoning. By applying a multi-class probing method, we identify the attention heads responsible for these functions. Our analysis across multiple LLM families reveals that attention heads exhibit functional specialization, characterized as cognitive heads. These cognitive heads exhibit several key properties: they are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across different cognitive functions, and display interactive and hierarchical structures. We further show that cognitive heads play a vital role in reasoning tasks - removing them leads to performance degradation, while augmenting them enhances reasoning accuracy. These insights offer a deeper understanding of LLM reasoning and suggest important implications for model design, training, and fine-tuning strategies."}

Under Bd, an individual is chosen for reproduction proportional to fitness, and its offspring replaces a randomly chosen neighbor. Here we study mixed updating between those two scenarios. In each time step, with probability $δ$ the update is dB and with remaining probability it is Bd. We study fixation probabilities and times as functions of $δ$ under constant selection. Despite the fact that fixation probabilities and times can be increasing, decreasing, or non-monotonic in $δ$, we prove nearly all unweighted undirected graphs have short fixation times and provide an efficient algorithm to estimate their fixation probabilities.

BBB-penetrating peptides (BBBPs) offer a promising strategy for brain drug delivery; however, the scarcity of positive samples and severe class imbalance hinder the reliable identification of BBBPs.\n  Objectives: Our goal is to alleviate class imbalance in BBBP prediction and to develop an accurate, interpretable classifier for BBBP prediction.\n  Methods: We propose DREAM-B3P, which couples a feedback diffusion model (FB-Diffusion) for data augmentation with a dual-stream Transformer for classification. FB-Diffusion learns the BBBP distribution via iterative denoising and uses an external analyzer to provide feedback, generating high-quality pseudo-BBBPs. The classifier contains a sequence stream that extracts structural features from peptide sequences and a physicochemical stream that captures physicochemical features such as hydrophobic surface area, molecular charge, number of rotatable bonds, and polarizability. Combining the two features leads to superior BBBP predictive performance.\n  Results: On a benchmark test set containing equal numbers of BBBPs and non-BBBPs, DREAM-B3P surpasses baseline methods (Deep-B3P, B3Pred, BBPpredict and Augur), improving AUC/ACC/MCC by 4.3\\%/17.8\\%/14.9\\%, respectively, over the second-best method.\n  Conclusion: By integrating feedback diffusion with a dual-stream Transformer classifier, DREAM-B3P effectively mitigates data scarcity and imbalance and achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

This review synthesizes the evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis, moving beyond the linear amyloid cascade hypothesis to conceptualize the disease as a cross-talk of intricately interacting pathologies, encompassing Abeta, tau, and neuroinflammation. This evolving pathophysiological understanding parallels a transformation in diagnostic paradigms, where biomarker-based strategies -- such as the AT(N) framework -- enable early disease detection during preclinical or prodromal stages. Within this new landscape, while anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab) represent a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapies, their modest efficacy underscores the limitation of single-target approaches. Therefore, this review explores the compelling rationale for combination therapies that simultaneously target Abeta pathology, aberrant tau, and neuroinflammation. Looking forward, we emphasize emerging technological platforms -- such as gene editing and biophysical neuromodulation -- n advancing precision medicine.

We first simulate an extinction-prone scenario in which initial densities fall below the Allee threshold, demonstrating that most populations tend toward extinction. We then introduce protected areas together with positive growth terms to facilitate survival. To assess the role of diffusion-reaction dynamics, we construct an objective function based on the shape and location of protected areas, and employ a bi-objective optimization approach. Our results reveal that as the weights of the objective function vary, the optimal protectedarea configuration shifts between fragmented and contiguous patterns.

Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \\emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery."}

Although this has been transformative in reducing new HIV infections among high-risk populations, it has also been linked to an increase in risk practices -- a phenomenon known as risk compensation -- thereby favoring the spread of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) deemed less severe. In this paper, we study a minimal compartmental model describing the effect of risk awareness and risk compensation due to PrEP on the spread of other STIs among a high-infection-risk group of men who have sex with men (MSM). The model integrates three key elements of risk-mediated behavior and PrEP programs: (i) HIV risk awareness drives self-protective behaviors (such as condom use and voluntary STI screening); (ii) individuals on PrEP are subject to risk compensation, but (iii) are required to screen for asymptomatic STIs frequently. We derived the basic reproduction number of the system, $R_0$, and found a transcritical bifurcation at $R_0=1$, where the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and an endemic equilibrium emerges. This endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable wherever it exists. We identified critical thresholds in behavioral and policy parameters that separate these regimes and analyzed typical values for plausible parameter choices. Beyond the specific epidemiological context, the model serves as a general framework for studying nonlinear interactions between behavioral adaptation, preventive interventions, and disease dynamics, providing insights into how feedback mechanisms can lead to non-trivial responses in epidemic systems.

We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \\textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/MolSculpt."}

Work in progress -- comments welcome!", "summary": "We propose Symmetry-Loss, a brain-inspired algorithmic principle that enforces invariance and equivariance through a differentiable constraint derived from environmental symmetries. The framework models learning as the iterative refinement of an effective symmetry group, paralleling developmental processes in which cortical representations align with the world's structure. By minimizing structural surprise, i.e. deviations from symmetry consistency, Symmetry-Loss operationalizes a Free-Energy--like objective for representation learning. This formulation bridges predictive-coding and group-theoretic perspectives, showing how efficient, stable, and compositional representations can emerge from symmetry-based self-organization. The result is a general computational mechanism linking developmental learning in the brain with principled representation learning in artificial systems."}

We developed a general optimization framework to balance costs related to infection and to mitigation. Optimizing the trade-off between mitigation and infection cost, we identified three novel, surprising effects: First, assuming a constant reproduction number $R_0$, the optimal response to an infectious disease requires either strict mitigation or none at all, depending on disease severity, but never does one find an intermediate mitigation level to be optimal. Second, under seasonal variations, optimal mitigation is stricter during winter. Interestingly, a single wave of infections still arises in spring with 3 months delay to the seasonal peak of infectivity, replacing the autumn/winter waves known for classical influenza. Third, during steady vaccination campaigns, even optimal mitigation can result in transient infection waves. Finally, we quantify the cost of delayed mitigation onset and show that even short delays can substantially increase total costs -- if the disease is severe. Overall, our framework is easily applicable to general and complex settings and thereby presents a versatile tool to explore optimal mitigation strategies for endemic and pandemic infectious disease."}

We propose a biologically inspired mathematical model that uses this idea to identify and separate the self from the environment and then build and use a self-model for better predictions. This is a model of neocortical columns governed by the basal ganglia to make predictions and choose the next action, where some columns act as 'what' columns and others act as 'where' columns. Based on this model, we present a reinforcement learning agent that learns purposeful behavior in a virtual environment. We evaluate the agent on the Atari games Pong and Breakout, where it successfully learns to play. We conclude that the ability to separate the self from the environment gives advantages to the agent and therefore such a model could appear in living organisms during evolution. We propose Self-Awareness Principle 1: the ability to separate the self from the world is a necessary but insufficient condition for self-awareness."}

Our approach uses a combined data-augmentation and importance sampling scheme. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to leverage existing highly optimized phylogenetic software. We apply our approach to the reconstruction of B cell receptor affinity maturation lineages from high-throughput repertoire sequencing data and evaluate the impact of incorporating site-dependence on the reconstruction accuracy of both trees and ancestral sequences. We show that accounting for context-dependence during inference always improves the estimates of both ancestral sequences and lineage trees on simulated datasets. We also examine the impact of incorporating priors based on VDJ recombination models, and find that they significantly improve ancestral sequence reconstruction in germline-encoded regions, but increase errors in non-templated nucleotides. We propose a modified, piecewise prior to address this demonstrate that it improves empirical reconstruction accuracy. We apply our approach to the analysis of the HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies DH270 and CH235 which are important targets of current vaccine design efforts."}

The concept of cognitome, introduced by the academician K.V. Anokhin, as the cognitive structure of the mind -- a high-order structure of the brain and a neural hypernetwork, is considered as the basis for modeling. Consciousness then is a special form of dynamics in this hypernetwork -- a large-scale integration of its cognitive elements. The cognitome, in turn, consists of interconnected COGs (cognitive groups of neurons) of two types -- functional systems and cellular ensembles. K.V. Anokhin sees the task of the fundamental theory of the brain and mind in describing these structures, their origin, functions and processes in them. The paper presents mathematical models of these structures based on new mathematical results, as well as models of different cognitive processes in terms of these models. In addition, it is shown that these models can be derived based on a fairly general principle of the brain works: \\textit{the brain discovers all possible causal relationships in the external world and draws all possible conclusions from them}. Based on these results, the paper presents models of: ``natural\" classification; theory of functional brain systems by P.K. Anokhin; prototypical theory of categorization by E. Roche; theory of causal models by Bob Rehter; theory of consciousness as integrated information by G. Tononi."}

While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness."}

However, it remains challenging to effectively integrate multimodal MRI while achieving neuroscience interpretability. Here we propose to use Laplacian harmonics and spectral graph theory for multimodal alignment and multiscale integration. Based on the cortical mesh and connectome matrix that offer multi-scale representations, we devise Laplacian operators and spectral graph attentions to construct a shared latent space for model alignment. Next, we employ a disentangled learning combined with Graph Variational Autoencoder architectures to separate scale-specific and shared features. Lastly, we design a mutual information-informed bilevel regularizer to separate causal and non-causal factors based on the disentangled features, achieving robust model performance with enhanced interpretability. Our model outperforms baselines and other state-of-the-art models. The ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

We develop a mathematical framework that captures the coupled reaction-diffusion processes governing serotonin signaling in realistic tissue microenvironments. Formulating a two-dimensional compartmental-reaction diffusion system, we use strong localized perturbation theory to derive an asymptotically equivalent set of nonlinear integro-ODEs that preserve diffusive coupling while enabling efficient computation. We analyze period-averaged steady states, establish bounds using Jensen's inequality, obtain closed-form spike maxima and minima, and implement a fast marching-scheme solver based on sum-of-exponentials kernels. These mathematical results provide quantitative insight into how firing frequency, varicosity geometry, and uptake kinetics shape extracellular serotonin. The model reveals that varicosities form diffusively coupled microdomains capable of generating spatial \"serotonin reservoirs,\" clarifies aspects of local versus volume transmission, and yields predictions relevant to interpreting high-resolution serotonin imaging and the actions of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors."}

Current models, however, are often trained using a mask-and-reconstruct objective on small brain regions. This focus on low-level information leads to representations that are sensitive to noise and temporal fluctuations, necessitating extensive fine-tuning for downstream tasks. We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series. We demonstrate that learned representations enable strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks even when only using a linear probe. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive scaling analyses indicating more unlabeled data reliably results in out-of-distribution performance gains without domain adaptation."}
