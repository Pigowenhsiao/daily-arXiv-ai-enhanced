We validate our protocol using synthetic\nimaging data and show that a reliable detection of active L\\'evy particles\nrequires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its\npersistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and\nE. gracilis, we find that E. coli exhibits no signature of L\\'evy walks, while\nE. gracilis is better described as active L\\'evy particles."}

We\nintroduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal\ntrajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By\nrepresenting local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models\nthe evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport\nand Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global\nspatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse\nspatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development."}

Capture phases mark the successful entry of a protein into the pore\nand serve as both a checkpoint and a signal that a channel merits further\nanalysis. However, manual identification of capture phases is time-intensive,\noften requiring several days for expert reviewers to annotate the data due to\nthe need for domain-specific interpretation of complex signal patterns. To\naddress this, a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D\nCNN) was developed and trained to detect capture phases in down-sampled signal\nwindows. Evaluated against CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) hybrids,\nhistogram-based classifiers, and other CNN variants using run-level data\nsplits, our best model, CaptureNet-Deep, achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and\nprecision of 93.39% on held-out test data. The model supports low-latency\ninference and is integrated into a dashboard for Oxford Nanopore experiments,\nreducing the total analysis time from several days to under thirty minutes.\nThese results show that efficient, real-time capture detection is possible\nusing simple, interpretable architectures and suggest a broader role for\nlightweight ML models in sequencing workflows."}

Focusing on the hippocampus, we\nconstruct a principal surface that captures the spatial distribution and\nmorphological changes of tau pathology. By projecting voxels onto this surface,\nwe quantify tau coverage, intensity, and thickness through bidirectional\nprojection distances and interpolated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR).\nThis low-dimensional embedding preserves spatial specificity while mitigating\nmultiple comparison issues. Covariate effects are analyzed using a two-stage\nregression model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for signal\nsparsity and selection bias. Using the SuStaIn model, we identify subtypes and\nstages of AD, revealing distinct tau dynamics: the limbic-predominant subtype\nshows age-related nonlinear accumulation in coverage and thickness, whereas the\nposterior subtype exhibits uniform SUVR increases across disease progression.\nModel-based predictions show that hippocampal tau deposition follows a\nstructured spatial trajectory expanding bidirectionally with increasing\nthickness, while subtype differences highlight posterior hippocampal\ninvolvement consistent with whole-brain patterns. Finally, directional signal\npatterns on the principal surface reveal contamination from the choroid plexus,\ndemonstrating the broader applicability of the proposed framework across\nmodalities including amyloid PET."}
