Current interpretations rely on descriptive catalogues of molecules and reactions, obscuring how redox behaviour emerges from constrained biochemical organisation. Here, we present a mathematical theory of redox biology that resolves this gap by treating redox systems as finite, compositional, dynamical, and spatially embedded objects. We define a structured redox state space in which admissible molecular transformations form a neutral algebra of possibilities. Biological function emerges when this structure is embedded within a wider molecular network and interpreted through weighted flux distributions. Time-dependent reweighting of these transformations generates redox dynamics, while spatial embedding enforces locality and causality, yielding a distributed redox field. Within this framework, context dependence, nonlinearity, hysteresis, and memory arise naturally from bounded state spaces and irreversible transformations, without requiring ad hoc assumptions. This theory provides a working, predictive interpretative basis for redox biology: it constrains admissible states and trajectories, clarifies the meaning of redox measurements, and links chemical transformation to biological behaviour. Redox biology emerges as a geometric, dynamical process governed by lawful organisation."}

Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_β$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\\sim$20\\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches."}

In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations."}

Evidence of bacterial ribosomal RNA in human brain tissue suggests that low-biomass microbial exposure may influence the inflammatory microenvironment surrounding implants. This study examined if microbial signal is detectable in unaltered brain tissue and if catheter implantation produces microbial shifts relevant to shunt dysfunction. Methods: Twenty-nine female mice were assigned to unaltered control (UC), trauma control (TC), plain silicone catheter (PSC), or antibiotic-impregnated catheter (AIC) groups. Brain and cecum tissues were harvested at postoperative days 7 and 28 for 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial composition and predicted functional pathways were analyzed. A separate cohort underwent longitudinal MRI to assess edema, glial scar formation, and macrophage-associated susceptibility signal. Results: Low-level microbial signal was detected in unaltered brain tissue. Catheter implantation induced material-dependent shifts in brain-associated microbial composition. PSC was associated with enrichment of pro-inflammatory taxa, whereas AIC favored immune-regulatory taxa. Predicted short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis was highest in AIC and lowest in PSC, while predicted lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis trended higher in PSC. MRI showed similar edema resolution but higher macrophage-associated susceptibility signal in PSC animals. Conclusion: Intracranial catheter implantation produces material-dependent shifts in low-biomass brain-associated microbial signal that parallel differential neuroimmune activation. These findings suggest catheter material may shape a biologically relevant peri-catheter niche with implications for chronic gliosis and proximal shunt obstruction."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce AbFlow, a flow-matching framework that leverages optimal transport to design full-atom antibodies end-to-end. AbFlow incorporates an extended velocity field network featuring an equivariant Surface Multi-channel Encoder, which uses surface-level antigen interaction data to refine the antibody structure, particularly the CDR-H3 region.

However, most existing approaches emphasize whole-brain age prediction and therefore overlook the pronounced regional heterogeneity of brain maturation that is crucial for detecting localized atypical trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose a novel spherical surface-based brain age prediction network (SurfAge-Net) that leverages multiple morphological metrics to capture region-specific developmental patterns with enhanced robustness and clinical interpretability. SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations. These results established fine-grained brain age prediction as a promising paradigm for advancing neurodevelopmental research and supporting early clinical assessment."}

This task is challenging due to the noisy and sparse nature of single-cell measurements, as well as the fact that perturbations often induce population-level shifts rather than changes in individual cells. Existing deep learning methods typically assume cell-level correspondences, limiting their ability to capture such global effects. We present scDFM, a generative framework based on conditional flow matching that models the full distribution of perturbed cells conditioned on control states. By incorporating a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective, our method aligns perturbed and control populations beyond cell-level correspondences. To further improve robustness to sparsity and noise, we introduce the Perturbation-Aware Differential Transformer (PAD-Transformer), a backbone architecture that leverages gene interaction graphs and differential attention to capture context-specific expression changes. Across multiple genetic and drug perturbation benchmarks, scDFM consistently outperforms prior methods, demonstrating strong generalization in both unseen and combinatorial settings. In the combinatorial setting, it reduces mean squared error by 19.6% relative to the strongest baseline.

Existing studies have focused on punishments within a homogeneous population, paying little attention to cooperative dynamics in a situation where belonging to a subset is equally important to the actual strategy represented by an actor. To fill this gap, we here study a bipartite population where cooperator agents in a public goods game penalize exclusively those defectors who belong to the alternative subset. We find that cooperation can emerge and remain stable under symmetric intergroup punishment. In particular, at low punishment intensity and at a small value of the enhancement factor of the dilemma game, intergroup punishment promotes cooperation more effectively than a uniformly applied punishment. Moreover, intergroup punishment in bipartite populations tends to be more favorable for overall social welfare. When this incentive is balanced, cooperators can collectively restrain defectors of the alternative set via aggregate interactions in a randomly formed working group, offering a more effective incentive. Conversely, breaking the symmetry of intergroup punishment inhibits cooperation, as the imbalance creates an Achilles' heel in the enforcement structure. Our work, thus, reveals symmetry in intergroup punishment as a unifying principle behind cooperation across human and biological systems."}

We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters. The low-complexity module, characterized by reduced entropy and curvature, consistently better predicted human language network activity. This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb).

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling."}

Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures."}

This paper identifies a new filter: depopulation. As an exospecies advances and reaches the top of the food chain on its planet, Darwinian evolution selects the species to breed fewer offspring due to a lack of predation. As the species evolves intelligence, this leads to medicines and most notably contraception, enabling the species to reduce infant mortality while controlling reproduction. Finally, economic, social and educational factors add to the conscious decision of the intelligent life to slow reproduction. These factors are currently contributing to a human global population peak mid century with subsequent population collapse in less than 500 years. Noting that population growth and decline is exponential, our modelling forecasts human extinction thresholds being tested sometime after the year 2500. There is no reason to assume depopulation dynamics (exodepopulation) would not apply to exocivilizations (exodemography), thus providing a possible resolution of the Fermi Paradox. Furthermore, as machines and AI inevitably supplement humans as depopulation accelerates, the Fermi Paradox can be restated as \"Why don't we see machines and AI colonising the galaxy?\" A plausible answer is machines will not become conscious and will continue to operate only as tools, tools that will cease operating once humanity is extinct. The Fermi Paradox can then be restated as \"Machines will not become conscious, otherwise we would see them colonising the galaxy\"."}

This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs."}

The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research."}

In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations."}

During line tracing, the gaze typically leads the hand through predictive saccades, yet the extent to which this predictive window reflects expertise or intrinsic individual traits remains unclear. In this study, I examined eye-hand coordination in professional calligraphers and non-experts performing a controlled line tracing task. The temporal coupling between saccade distance (SD) and pen speed (PS) revealed substantial interpersonal variability: SD-PS peak times ranged from approximately -50 to 400 ms, forming stable, participant-specific predictive windows that were consistent across trials. These predictive windows closely matched each individual's pen catch-up time, indicating that the oculomotor system stabilizes fixation in anticipation of the hand's future velocity rather than relying on reactive pursuit. Neither the spatial indices (mean gaze-pen distance, mean saccade distance) nor the temporal index (SD-PS peak time) differed between calligraphers and non-calligraphers, and none of these predictive parameters correlated with tracing accuracy. These findings suggest that diverse predictive strategies can achieve equivalent performance, consistent with the minimum intervention principle of optimal feedback control. Together, the results indicate that predictive timing in eye-hand coordination reflects a stable, idiosyncratic Predictive Protocol shaped by individual neuromotor constraints rather than by expertise or training history."}

The expansion of novel ecosystems (hybrids of natural and agricultural systems) is a sign of irreversible, human-induced change. Human growth, adaptation to climate change, urban expansion and geoengineering are powerful transformative drivers which are expected to have a high impact, creating novel ecosystems. In contrast, less transformative drivers such as degrowth, biocentrism, ecological restoration and low-impact agriculture can mitigate human impacts, leading to adaptation, resilience and sustainability, while conserving original ecosystems.

However, biological systems offer a broader repertoire of strategies for adaptive, goal-directed behavior - strategies that emerged long before nervous systems evolved. This paper advocates a genuinely life-inspired approach to machine intelligence, drawing on principles from biology that enable robustness, autonomy, and open-ended problem-solving across scales. We frame intelligence as flexible problem-solving, following William James, and develop the concept of \"cognitive light cones\" to characterize the continuum of intelligence in living systems and machines. We argue that biological evolution has discovered a scalable recipe for intelligence - and the progressive expansion of organisms' \"cognitive light cone\", predictive and control capacities. To explain how this is possible, we distill five design principles - multiscale autonomy, growth through self-assemblage of active components, continuous reconstruction of capabilities, exploitation of physical and embodied constraints, and pervasive signaling enabling self-organization and top-down control from goals - that underpin life's ability to navigate creatively diverse problem spaces. We discuss how these principles contrast with current AI paradigms and outline pathways for integrating them into future autonomous, embodied, and resilient artificial systems."}

While coordination can improve accuracy, it also delays responses as information propagates through the group. In changing environments, these delays can outweigh the benefits of centralized control, making decentralized strategies advantageous in large groups. This raises a key question: how can groups implement efficient collective decisions without central coordination? We address this question using a model of collective foraging in which individuals choose whether to invest in costly exploration or remain idle, while sharing information and rewards across the group. We show that decentralized collectives can match the performance of centrally controlled groups through a division of labor: a small, heterogeneous subset explores even when expected rewards are negative, while a synchronized majority forages only when expected rewards are positive. Information redundancy causes the optimal scout number to grow sublinearly with group size, so that larger groups need proportionally fewer explorers. The heterogeneity of the group is maximized at intermediate ecological pressures, but optimal groups are homogeneous when costs or environmental contrasts or fluctuations are extreme. Crucially, these group-level policies do not require central coordination, emerging instead from agents following simple threshold-based decision rules. We thus demonstrate a mechanism through which leaderless collectives can make effective decisions under uncertainty and show how ecological pressures can drive changes in the distribution of strategies employed by the group."}

In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods.
