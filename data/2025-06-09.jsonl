Overall, all hypothalamic\nsubregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical\nNetwork 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and\nweaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of\nposterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic\nsubregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to\nCortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior\nhypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity.\nThe findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in\nproviding a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects\nits complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture."}

Relating this collective activity to the network's connectivity\nstructure is a key goal of computational neuroscience. We approach this\nquestion for clustered networks, which can form via biologically realistic\nlearning rules and allow for the re-activation of learned patterns. Previous\nstudies of clustered networks have focused on metastabilty between fixed\npoints, leaving open the question of whether clustered spiking networks can\ndisplay more rich dynamics--and if so, whether these can be predicted from\ntheir connectivity. Here, we show that in the limits of large population size\nand fast inhibition, the combinatorial threshold linear network (CTLN) model is\na mean-field theory for inhibition-stabilized nonlinear Hawkes networks with\nclustered connectivity. The CTLN has a large body of ``graph rules'' relating\nnetwork structure to dynamics. By applying these, we can predict the dynamic\nattractors of our clustered spiking networks from the structure of\nbetween-cluster connectivity. This allows us to construct networks displaying a\ndiverse array of nonlinear cluster dynamics, including metastable periodic\norbits and chaotic attractors. Relaxing the assumption that inhibition is fast,\nwe see that the CTLN model is still able to predict the activity of clustered\nspiking networks with reasonable inhibitory timescales. For slow enough\ninhibition, we observe bifurcations between CTLN-like dynamics and global\nexcitatory/inhibitory oscillations."}

We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the\npretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize\n\\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct\ntasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of\ntask diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear\nfunctions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a\ntransition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the\npretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of\ndistribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the\nsolutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and\nobserve similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a\nphase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with\nthe number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as\nthe depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem\ninfluence the transition."}

Traditional biometric\nmodalities (fingerprint, face, iris, voice) rely on unique, stable features\nthat reliably differentiate individuals. Recently, the term fingerprinting has\ngained popularity in neuroscience, with a growing number of studies adopting\nthe term to describe various brain based metrics derived from different\ntechniques. However, we think there is a mismatch between its widely accepted\nmeaning in the biometric community and some brain based metrics. Many of these\nmeasures do not satisfy the strict definition of a biometric fingerprint that\nis, a stable trait that uniquely identifies an individual. In this study we\ndiscuss some issues that may generate confusion in this context and suggest how\nto treat the question in the future. In particular, we review how fingerprint\nis currently used in the neuroscience literature, highlight mismatches with the\nbiometric community definition, and offer clear guidelines for distinguishing\ngenuine biometric fingerprints from exploratory similarity metrics.

Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have\nseen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in\nmatching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this,\nwe propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs\nwith Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of\nsequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of\nspike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our\nstudy explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and\nprobabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised,\nand hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer\nWisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging.\nLB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models\nreached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an\nANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to\ntraditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower\ncomputational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with\nthe efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower\ncomputational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding,\nspike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient\nfeature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer\npromising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks\nin medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time\nsystems."}
