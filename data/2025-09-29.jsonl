In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is\ncaptured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which\nevolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version\nof the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it\nadmits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous\ntravelling wave solutions, wherein the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies\nacross the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a\nmathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic\nheterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour.\nWe then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the\nresults of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also\ndemonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on\ntumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge.

Recent work has demonstrated that\ntask-trained RNNs possess a strong simplicity bias. In particular, this\ninductive bias often causes RNNs trained on the same task to collapse on\neffectively the same solution, typically comprised of fixed-point attractors or\nother low-dimensional dynamical motifs. While such solutions are readily\ninterpretable, this collapse proves counterproductive for the sake of\ngenerating a set of genuinely unique hypotheses for how neural computations\nmight be performed. Here we propose Iterative Neural Similarity Deflation\n(INSD), a simple method to break this inductive bias. By penalizing linear\npredictivity of neural activity produced by standard task-trained RNNs, we find\nan alternative class of solutions to classic neuroscience-style RNN tasks.\nThese solutions appear distinct across a battery of analysis techniques,\nincluding representational similarity metrics, dynamical systems analysis, and\nthe linear decodability of task-relevant variables.

Memory is not a static store\nbut the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant\ncycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and\npreserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures\nthis: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode\nlow-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically,\npolychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking\nreinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary\ncancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation\nloops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces\nhigh-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations,\ngeneralizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this\nprocess: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves\ndecompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions\nwith bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of\nhigh-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness)\nacross contexts.

The\ncommunity requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing\nmodeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for\nintracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:\na suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the\nbrain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant\nelectrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal\nsignal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which\nconsists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a\nnaturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.\nFirst, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high\ntemporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine\nwhen and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the\nbrain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all\nelectrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from\nthe superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from\nsimple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely\ndata-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,\nNeuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures\nand training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly\nstrong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is\ndesigned with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind.
