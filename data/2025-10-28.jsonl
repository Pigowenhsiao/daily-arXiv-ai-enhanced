Generative\nAI models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular design, yet most remain\nspecialized for individual molecular types and lack fine-grained control over\ninteraction details. Here we present ODesign, an all-atom generative world\nmodel for all-to-all biomolecular interaction design. ODesign allows scientists\nto specify epitopes on arbitrary targets and generate diverse classes of\nbinding partners with fine-grained control. Across entity-, token-, and\natom-level benchmarks in the protein modality, ODesign demonstrates superior\ncontrollability and performance to modality-specific baselines. Extending\nbeyond proteins, it generalizes to nucleic acid and small-molecule design,\nenabling interaction types such as protein-binding RNA/DNA and RNA/DNA-binding\nligands that were previously inaccessible. By unifying multimodal biomolecular\ninteractions within a single generative framework, ODesign moves toward a\ngeneral-purpose molecular world model capable of programmable design.

Each\nspecification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a\nneural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic\nspecification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the\ncomplementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG\nis a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible\ninstances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that\nsatisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics\nfor such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and\n\\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,\nand outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In\nthis extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering.

Such organisations are abundant in nature, as\nsharing information is a key benefit of many biological collective systems, and\nhave been influential in the design of many artificial collectives such as\nswarm robotics. Understanding how these systems may be spatially distributed to\noptimise their collective potential is therefore of importance in both ecology\nand in collective systems design. Here, we develop a mathematical model which\nuses an optimisation framework to determine the higher-order spatial structure\nof a collective that optimises group-level knowledge transfer. The domain of\nthe objective function is a set of weighted simplicial sets, which can fully\nrepresent the spatial structure from a topological perspective. By varying the\nparameters within the objective function and the constraints, we determine how\nthe optimal spatial structure may vary when individuals differ in their\ninformation gathering ability and how this variation differs in the context of\nresource constraints. Our key findings are that the amount of resources in the\nenvironment can lead to specific subgroup sizes being optimal for the group as\na whole when individuals are homogeneous in their information gathering\nabilities. Further, when there is variation in information gathering abilities,\nour model implies that the sharing of space between smaller subgroups of the\npopulation, rather than the whole population, is optimal for collective\nknowledge sharing.
