In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence\nanalysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category,\ncapturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction.\nSubstructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation,\nand their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological\nfeatures. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by\nincorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology.\nThe resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across\na variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants\nand the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative\nstudies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in\nthese tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond\nsequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the\nintegration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence\nanalysis."}

In\ncomputer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and\nretrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in\nevolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts\nhas stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We\nrecently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices\npopular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary\ndegree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index\ngeneralizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced\ntree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus\nunifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide\nnew analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First,\nwe quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$\nunder two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model.\nSecond, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help\nestablish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that\ngeneralizes and supersedes prior approaches."}

A key challenge in\nlong-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the\ncomposition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across\nrecording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit\nalignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require\ntest-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across\nsessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In\nthis work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural\nTransformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on\nunordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel\ncontext-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers\nunit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording\nsessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows\nfew-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from\nthe test session. To further promote model robustness to population\nvariability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for\niBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We\nevaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,\ncovering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT\ndemonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing\nzero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for\ntest-time alignment and fine-tuning.

Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial\nfor understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases.

Additionally, we assess whether existing methods,\ndesigned for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict\nstructures of non-native intermediates.\n  Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural\ndata on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for\nco-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4\nintermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting\nnative structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native\nintermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on\npost-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods.\nYet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed\nexplicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating\nintrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise.\nThis study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of\n3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics."}
