Here we develop an eco-evolutionary framework in which individuals repeatedly interact with the same opponent and follow direct reciprocity through reactive strategies. The strategic dynamics is coupled to a renewable common resource and analyzed using adaptive dynamics. After our exhaustive non-linear dynamical analysis of $2\\times2$ strategic games, we focus on comparative and combined usefulness of institutional incentives in the form of rewards and punishments in preventing the Tragedy of the Commons even when defection dominates in the replete resource state. We also report possibility of robust stable oscillations -- emerging via Hopf bifurcation -- in resource state and population strategies."}

Using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays in reinnervated muscles, we show that neural signals for agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled: motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during corresponding antagonist tasks, despite no visual feedback on coactivation being provided."}

Murray"], "title": "Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "q-bio.NC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning."}
