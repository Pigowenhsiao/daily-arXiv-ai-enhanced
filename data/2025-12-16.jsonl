This study develops a model to predict Dabrafenib sensitivity by integrating multiple omics layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) with protein network embeddings generated using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Each modality is encoded into low dimensional representations through neural network preprocessing. Protein interaction information from STRING is incorporated using GCN to capture biological topology. An attention based fusion mechanism assigns adaptive weights to each modality according to its relevance. Using GDSC cancer cell line data, the model shows that selective integration of two modalities, especially proteomics and transcriptomics, achieves the best test performance (R2 around 0.96), outperforming all single omics and full multimodal settings. Genomic and epigenomic data were less informative, while proteomic and transcriptomic layers provided stronger phenotypic signals related to MAPK inhibitor activity. These results show that attention guided multi omics fusion combined with GCN improves drug response prediction and reveals complementary molecular determinants of Dabrafenib sensitivity. The approach offers a promising computational framework for precision oncology and predictive modeling of targeted therapies."}

This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \\emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \\emph{in vivo} and \\emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems."}

As these datasets grow, they motivate the development of specialized techniques capable of handling the dense sequence variation found in large groups of related genomes. A common strategy is to encode pangenomic information in graph form, which provides a flexible substrate for improving algorithms in areas such as alignment, visualization, and functional analysis. Methods built on these graph models have already shown clear advantages in core bioinformatics workflows, including read mapping, variant discovery, and genotyping. By integrating multiple sequence and coordinate representations into a single structure, pangenome graphs offer a unified and expressive framework for comparative genomics. Although it remains unclear whether graph-based references will ultimately supplant traditional linear genomes, their versatility ensures that they will play a central role in emerging pangenomic approaches. This paper introduces an algorithm to mine a chain of sequences in pangenome graphs that might be useful in the functional analysis of pangenome graphs. Specifically, the algorithm calculates all maximal paths in a pangenome graph aligning with a given chain of sequences in the segments of the path vertices, possibly with some maximal gap as specified by the user."}

However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide \"chains\" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments."}

To highlight the unintended consequences of such interventions and the necessity of understanding predator-prey dynamics in preserving ecological balance, a mathematical model incorporating snake, mongooses, mouse and natural resources has been proposed to explore their role in the ongoing ecological disaster and analysis the other scenarios if the authorities applied different approaches in place of already implemented strategy. Determining the model's existence and uniqueness, stability at equilibrium points, and state variable characteristics are some of the parts of the analytical analysis of the model. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify sensitive factors. In addition, the Runge-Kutta 4th order has been used to execute the numerical simulations. Our research reveals that although the government began killing and trapping mongooses almost 20 years after their introduction, but if trapping had started just 10 years after their introduction, the outcome could have been drastically different. This time, mongooses would not have been extinct, and their coexistence with other native species would have helped to preserve the ecological balance and prevent the severe ecological damage that is presently being seen. Thus, It is recommended to use mathematical modeling to explore alternatives before decision-making, ensuring sustainable ecosystem management while preventing irreversible impacts of invasive species."}

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides vast data for computational GRN reconstruction. Since GRNs are ideally modeled as signed directed graphs to capture activation/inhibition relationships, the most intuitive and reasonable approach is to design feature extractors based on the topological structure of GRNs to extract structural features, then combine them with biological characteristics for research. However, traditional spectral graph convolution struggles with this representation. Thus, we propose MSGRNLink, a novel framework that explicitly models GRNs as signed directed graphs and employs magnetic signed Laplacian convolution. Experiments across simulated and real datasets demonstrate that MSGRNLink outperforms all baseline models in AUROC. Parameter sensitivity analysis and ablation studies confirmed its robustness and the importance of each module.

Single-omics predictors are often insufficient because drug response is shaped by interactions among genomic alterations, epigenetic regulation, transcriptional activity, protein signaling, metabolic state, and network-level context. In this study we develop an attention-based multi-omics integration framework using genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and protein interaction data from the GDSC1 panel. Each modality is encoded into a latent representation using feed-forward neural networks or graph convolutional networks, and fused through an attention mechanism that assigns modality-specific importance weights. A regression model is then used to predict PLX-4720 response. Across single- and multi-omics configurations, the best performance is achieved by integrating genomics and transcriptomics, which yields validation R2 values above 0.92. This reflects the complementary roles of mutational status and downstream transcriptional activation in shaping sensitivity to BRAF inhibition. Epigenomics is the strongest single-omics predictor, while metabolomics and PPI data contribute additional context when combined with other modalities. Integration of three to five omics layers improves stability but does not surpass the accuracy of the best two-modality combinations, likely due to information redundancy and sample-size imbalance. These findings highlight the importance of modality selection rather than maximal data depth. The proposed framework provides an efficient and biologically grounded strategy for drug response prediction and supports the development of precision pharmacogenomics."}

A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues."}

While Finite Element Analysis (FEA) provides the necessary fidelity to quantify these injury-inducing loads, its high computational cost precludes clinical utility. Emerging deep surrogate models promise real-time assessment but suffer a critical blind spot: they predominantly focus on learning anatomical variations, largely overlooking the neuromuscular control patterns. These dynamic, subject-specific motor strategies fundamentally dictate potentially injurious stress distributions inside the knee. Methods: This study investigates the generalization capability of the topology-aware MeshGraphNet regarding cross-subject neuromuscular control patterns under fixed anatomical conditions. We constructed a dataset using gait data from nine subjects via an OpenSim-FEBio co-simulation platform. The MGN was compared against a structure-agnostic Node-wise MLP using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects. Results: The MGN demonstrated superior fidelity, achieving a correlation of 0.94 with ground truth (vs. 0.88 for MLP). In contrast to the MLP, which exhibited the \"peak shaving\" defect common in deep learning, MGN significantly reduced peak-stress prediction errors and achieved higher spatial overlap in high-risk regions. This indicates that MGN effectively captured the non-local force-transmission pathways unique to each subject's movement strategy. Conclusion: By mimicking the propagation of physical stress through message passing, MGN successfully decodes the heterogeneity of human neuromuscular control, even under fixed anatomy. This establishes GNNs as robust clinical tools capable of identifying functional injury risks that are invisible to purely geometry-based surrogate models."}

The main motivation comes from individual-based models (IBMs) of microbial aggregates, where simulations reveal that substrate-limited conditions can give rise to rich spatial patterns. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our PDE-based model captures the key qualitative features of three verification scenarios that have previously been investigated with IBMs. Moreover, we formally derive a competition system from an on-lattice biased random walk, and establish local well-posedness for a parameter-symmetric subcase of it.

This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans.

Traditional information criteria, such as the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Mallows's $\\mathit{C_p}$, are valuable tools for identifying optimal models. However, the exponential increase in candidate models with each additional model parameter renders the evaluation of these criteria for all models -- a strategy known as exhaustive, or brute-force, searches -- computationally prohibitive. Consequently, heuristic approaches like stepwise regression are commonly employed, albeit without guarantees of finding the globally-optimal model.\n  In this study, we challenge the prevailing notion that non-monotonicity in information criteria precludes bounds on the search space. We introduce a simple but novel bound that enables the development of branch-and-bound algorithms tailored for these non-monotonic functions. We demonstrate that our approach guarantees identification of the optimal model(s) across diverse model classes, sizes, and applications, often with orders of magnitude computational speedups.

A scenario consists of generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of 'cell' in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). The inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software, or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows natural or altered conditions (pharmacology, pathology, development) to be simulated."}

While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object."}

Unlike existing tools restricted to specific modification types, OmniNovo learns universal fragmentation rules to decipher diverse PTMs within a single coherent model. By integrating a mass-constrained decoding algorithm with rigorous false discovery rate estimation, OmniNovo achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, identifying 51\\% more peptides than standard approaches at a 1\\% false discovery rate.

Here we propose a mechanistic model of human mental rotation, leveraging advances in deep, equivariant, and neuro-symbolic learning. Our model consists of three stacked components: (1) an equivariant neural encoder, taking images as input and producing 3D spatial representations of objects, (2) a neuro-symbolic object encoder, deriving symbolic descriptions of objects from these spatial representations, and (3) a neural decision agent, comparing these symbolic descriptions to prescribe rotation simulations in 3D latent space via a recurrent pathway. Our model design is guided by the abundant experimental literature on mental rotation, which we complemented with experiments in VR where participants could at times manipulate the objects to compare, providing us with additional insights into the cognitive process of mental rotation. Our model captures well the performance, response times and behavior of participants in our and others' experiments. The necessity of each model component is shown through systematic ablations. Our work adds to a recent collection of deep neural models of human spatial reasoning, further demonstrating the potency of integrating deep, equivariant, and symbolic representations to model the human mind."}

This work leverages the combined use of predictability and information measures to detect and quantify HOBs in synthetic and physiological network systems. After providing formal definitions of mechanisms and behaviors in a complex system, measures of statistical synergy are defined as the whole-minus-sum excess of mutual predictability ($Δ_\\textrm{MP}$) or mutual information ($Δ_\\textrm{MI}$) obtained when considering the system as a whole rather than as a combination of its units. The two measures are computed using model-free methods based on nonlinear prediction and entropy estimation. The application to simulated linear Gaussian systems and nonlinear deterministic and stochastic dynamic systems shows that $Δ_\\textrm{MP}$ tends to vanish for target variables influenced by additive effects of single independent source variables and is positive in the presence of group interactions between sources, while $Δ_\\textrm{MI}$ exhibits a higher propensity to display positive values. The analysis of physiological variables shows significant values of $Δ_\\textrm{MI}$ when investigating the additive effect of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure on mean arterial pressure, and of both $Δ_\\textrm{MP}$ and $Δ_\\textrm{MI}$ when assessing how diastolic pressure is modulated by pre-ejection and left-ventricular ejection times. HOBs can be more clearly identified by information-theoretic measures, while prediction measures are more sensitive to synergy arising from the governing rules of the system analyzed rather than from pure statistical dependencies. Quantifying HOBs through measures sensitive to structural mechanisms can provide biomarkers to assess physio-pathological alterations of cardiovascular networks."}

This study applied network-based EEG source analysis to examine oscillatory cortical activity during cognitive and emotional Go/NoGo tasks in individuals with ADHD. EEG data from 272 participants (ADHD n equals 102, controls n equals 170, age range 6 to 60 years) were analyzed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography combined with functional independent component analysis, yielding ten frequency-resolved cortical networks. Mixed-effects ANCOVAs were conducted on independent component loadings with Group, Task, and Condition as factors and age and sex as covariates. ADHD participants showed statistically significant but small increases in activation across several networks, including a gamma-dominant inferior temporal component showing a Group effect and a Group by Condition interaction with stronger NoGo-related activation in ADHD. Two additional components showed similar but weaker NoGo-selective patterns. A main effect of Task emerged only for one temporal delta component, with higher activation during the VCPT than the ECPT. No Group by Task interactions were observed. Behavioral results replicated the established ADHD performance profile, with slower responses, greater variability, and higher error rates, particularly during the emotional ECPT. Overall, the findings reveal subtle alterations in oscillatory brain networks during inhibitory processing in ADHD, with modest effect sizes embedded within substantial within-group variability. These results support a dimensional view of ADHD neurobiology and highlight the limited discriminative power of network-level EEG markers."}

This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects."}

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

This process is often performed by hand, relying on a skill practiced over many years, and attempted for small models. Nondimensionalization is often considered an art, as there is no formal method accessible to applied scientists. Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations. We further prove that any dimensionally consistent change of variables preserves the dimension of the maximal scaling symmetry. We showcase the framework on various models, including the classical Michaelis-Menten equations, which serves as a benchmark for asking and answering specific modeling questions."}

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches.
