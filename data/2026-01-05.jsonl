This paper uses Hilbert-space/operator formalism as a quantum-probabilistic (quantum cognition) modeling language for contextual cognition; it makes no claims about physical quantum processes, hence q-bio.NC is the intended primary category", "summary": "Many of the most consequential dynamics in human cognition occur \\emph{before} events become explicit: before decisions are finalized, emotions are labeled, or meanings stabilize into narrative form. These pre-event states are characterized by ambiguity, contextual tension, and competing latent interpretations. Rogue Variable Theory (RVT) formalizes such states as \\emph{Rogue Variables}: structured, pre-event cognitive configurations that influence outcomes while remaining unresolved or incompatible with a system's current representational manifold. We present a quantum-consistent information-theoretic implementation of RVT based on a time-indexed \\emph{Mirrored Personal Graph} (MPG) embedded into a fixed graph Hilbert space, a normalized \\emph{Quantum MPG State} (QMS) constructed from node and edge metrics under context, Hamiltonian dynamics derived from graph couplings, and an error-weighted `rogue operator'' whose principal eigenvectors identify rogue factor directions and candidate Rogue Variable segments. We further introduce a \\emph{Rosetta Stone Layer} (RSL) that maps user-specific latent factor coordinates into a shared reference Hilbert space to enable cross-user comparison and aggregation without explicit node alignment. The framework is fully implementable on classical systems and does not assume physical quantum processes; \\emph{collapse} is interpreted as informational decoherence under interaction, often human clarification."}

While sharing raw CT and MRI scans has become routine, distributing value-added segmented datasets, where anatomical structures are precisely labeled and delineated, remains difficult and rare. Current repositories function primarily as static archives, lacking mechanisms for iterative refinement, community-driven curation, standardized orientation protocols, and the controlled terminology essential for downstream computational applications, including artificial intelligence, to help us analyze and interpret these unprecedented data resources.\n  We introduce MorphoDepot, a framework that adapts the \"fork-and-contribute\" model, a cornerstone of modern open-source software development, for collaborative management of 3D morphological data. By integrating git version control and GitHub's \"social\" collaborative infrastructure with 3D Slicer and its SlicerMorph extension, MorphoDepot transforms segmented anatomical datasets from static resources into dynamic, community-curated projects. This approach directly addresses the challenges of distributed collaboration, enforces transparent provenance tracking, and creates high-quality, standardized training data for AI model development. The result is a system that embodies FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles while creating powerful new opportunities for remote learning and collaborative science for biological sciences in general and evolutionary morphology in particular."}

To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors' choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies."}

Domain-aware VFL achieves an AUROC of 0.833 plus or minus 0.030 after reducing dimensionality by 98.6 percent, significantly outperforming NVFlare VFL, which performs at chance level (AUROC 0.500 plus or minus 0.125, p = 0.0058). LASER shows modest improvement (AUROC 0.600 plus or minus 0.215) but exhibits higher variance and does not reach statistical significance.\n  Domain-aware feature selection yields stable top-feature sets across analysis parameters. Negative control experiments using permuted labels produce AUROC values below chance (0.262), confirming the absence of data leakage and indicating that observed performance arises from genuine biological signal. These results motivate design principles for VFL in extreme P much greater than N regimes, emphasizing domain-informed dimensionality reduction and stability-focused evaluation."}

To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected. This makes SHMT an underexplored yet promising target for the rational design of next-generation antibacterial agents."}

However, maintaining the structural integrity of bioprinted materials remains a major challenge, primarily due to the frequent and unexpected formation of hidden defects. Traditional defect detection methods often require physical contact that may not be suitable for hydrogel-based biomaterials due to their inherently soft nature, making non-invasive and straightforward structural evaluation necessary in this field. To advance the state of the art, this study presents a novel non-contact method for non-destructively detecting structural defects in bioprinted constructs using video-based vibration analysis. Ear-shaped constructs were fabricated using a bioink composed of sodium alginate and \\k{appa}-carrageenan using extrusion-based bioprinting. To simulate printing defects, controlled geometric, interlayer, and pressure-induced defects were systematically introduced into the samples. The dynamic response of each structure was recorded using a high-speed camera and analyzed via phase-based motion estimation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that all defective samples exhibit consistent changes in the dynamic characteristics compared to baseline samples, with increasingly pronounced deviation observed as defect severity increases, which reflect changes in effective stiffness and mass distribution induced by internal anomalies, even when such defects are not detectable through surface inspection. The experimental trends were also validated through finite element simulations. Overall, this work demonstrates that video-based vibrometry is a powerful approach for assessing the quality of bioprinted constructs, offering a practical pathway toward robust structural health monitoring in next-generation bio-additive manufacturing workflows."}

Advanced single-cell multimodal assays can now simultaneously measure various molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, Protein) across hundreds of thousands of individual cells, providing a comprehensive molecular readout. A significant analytical challenge is integrating single-cell measurements across different modalities. Various methods have been developed to address this challenge, but there has been no systematic evaluation of these techniques with different preprocessing strategies. This study examines a general pipeline for single-cell data analysis, which includes normalization, data integration, and dimensionality reduction. The performance of different algorithm combinations often depends on the dataset sizes and characteristics. We evaluate six datasets across diverse modalities, tissues, and organisms using three metrics: Silhouette Coefficient Score, Adjusted Rand Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. Our experiments involve combinations of seven normalization methods, four dimensional reduction methods, and five integration methods. The results show that Seurat and Harmony excel in data integration, with Harmony being more time-efficient, especially for large datasets. UMAP is the most compatible dimensionality reduction method with the integration techniques, and the choice of normalization method varies depending on the integration method used."}

Although prior work has revealed that network structure and multiplex interactions can promote cooperation, most theory assumes that individuals play similar dilemma games in all social contexts. However, real-world agents may participate in a diversity of interactions, not all of which present dilemmas. We develop an evolutionary game model on multilayer networks in which one layer supports the prisoner's dilemma game, while the other follows constant-selection dynamics, representing biased but non-dilemmatic competition, akin to opinion or fad spreading. Our theoretical analysis reveals that coupling a social dilemma layer to a non-dilemmatic constant-selection layer robustly enhances cooperation in many cases, across different multilayer networks, updating rules, and payoff schemes. These findings suggest that embedding individuals within diverse networked settings -- even those unrelated to direct social dilemmas -- can be a principled approach to engineering cooperation in socio-ecological and organizational systems."}

This study evaluates novel encoding strategies that reduce CGM profiles to a compact set of landmark points while maintaining fidelity in reconstructed signals and derived glycemic metrics.\n  Methods: We utilized two complementary CGM datasets, synthetic data generated via a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and real-world measurements from a randomized crossover trial, to develop and validate three encoding approaches: (1) Peaks & Nadirs (PN), (2) Peaks, Nadirs, and Support Points (PN+), and (3) Uniform Downsampling. Each method compresses CGM profiles by selecting key timestamps and glucose values, followed by signal reconstruction via interpolation. Performance was assessed using compression ratio, mean absolute error (MAE), and R^2 between original and reconstructed clinically relevant CGM-derived metrics. Statistical analyses evaluated the preservation of clinically relevant glucose features.\n  Results: Across varying compression settings, PN+ consistently outperformed PN and downsampling, achieving the highest R^2 and lowest MAE. At a compression ratio of 13 (22 landmark points per 24-hour profile), PN+ reduced MAE by a factor of 3.6 compared to downsampling (0.77 vs. 2.75), with notable improvements in metrics sensitive to glucose excursions. Encoding and decoding required an average of 0.13 seconds per profile. Validation on real-world data confirmed these trends.\n  Conclusions: The proposed PN+ method produces a compact CGM representation that retains critical glycemic dynamics while discarding redundant portions of the profiles. The CGM signal can be reconstructed with high precision from the encoding representation."}

The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages."}

The major problem with that initial algorithm was the requirement for calculating and storing in memory the two-dimensional RMSD matrix of the currently available trajectory. This requirement precluded the application of the method to very long simulations. Here we describe a new variant of the Good-Turing algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the number of structures in the trajectory, making it suitable even for extremely long simulations. We show that the new method gives essentially identical results with the older implementation, and present results obtained from trajectories containing up to 22 million structures. A computer program implementing the new algorithm is available from standard repositories."}

Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor."}

Using information theory and the Lambda phage lysis-lysogeny decision as a model system, we discover that hierarchical control operates through hierarchical preemption - higher layers collapse decision space rather than blocking lower-layer signals. Through mutual information (MI) analysis of 200 stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that the UV damage sensor (RecA) achieves 2.01x information advantage over environmental signals by preempting bistable outcomes into monostable attractors (98% lysogenic or 85% lytic). Conditional MI analysis reveals that the integrator signal (CII) carries lower information when RecA is absent (saturated, 0.06 bits) than when RecA is active (subsaturated, 0.38 bits). This saturation effect demonstrates that signals orchestrate compartment behaviors by removing decision space - achieving 85-98% outcome certainty while preserving 2-15% escape routes.
