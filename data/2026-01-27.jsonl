Mutations in the \\textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \\textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the \"Quantum Cliff,\" where minute structural changes (below 0.1 Å) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling."}

While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation.

FASTQ, the standard format for over two decades, stores one byte per base and one byte per quality score, leading to inefficient I/O, high storage costs, and redundancy. Existing compression tools can mitigate some issues, but often introduce costly decompression or complex dependency issues. Results: We introduce FASTR, a lossless, computation-native successor to FASTQ that encodes each nucleotide together with its base quality score into a single 8-bit value. FASTR reduces file size by at least 2x while remaining fully reversible and directly usable for downstream analyses. Applying general-purpose compression tools on FASTR consistently yields higher compression ratios, 2.47, 3.64, and 4.8x faster compression, and 2.34, 1.96, 1.75x faster decompression than on FASTQ across Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads. FASTR is machine-learning-ready, allowing reads to be consumed directly as numerical vectors or image-like representations. We provide a highly parallel software ecosystem for FASTQ-FASTR conversion and show that FASTR integrates with existing tools, such as minimap2, with minimal interface changes and no performance overhead. By eliminating decompression costs and reducing data movement, FASTR lays the foundation for scalable genomics analyses and real-time sequencing workflows.

Current geometric deep learning methods typically treat proteins as monolithic graphs, failing to capture the distinct geometric and energetic signals at domain interfaces. To address this, we introduce DAGML (Domain-Aware Geometric Multimodal Learning), a hierarchical framework that explicitly models domain modularity. DAGML integrates a pre-trained protein language model with a novel domain-aware geometric encoder to distinguish intra- and inter-domain features, while a motif-centric ligand encoder captures pharmacophoric compatibility. We further curate a specialized multi-domain affinity benchmark, classifying complexes by binding topology (e.g., interface vs linker binders). Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAGML achieves a 21% reduction in MSE and a Pearson correlation of 0.726 compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies reveal that explicit modeling of domain interfaces is the primary driver of this improvement, particularly for ligands binding in the clefts between structural units.

We present Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA), a framework in which stochastic assembly combined with differential persistence biases populations toward longer-lived motifs. Assemblies that persist longer become more frequent and are therefore more likely to participate in subsequent interactions, generating feedback that reshapes the population distribution and implements fitness-proportional sampling, realizing evolution as a natural, emergent genetic algorithm (SDA/GA) driven solely by stability. We apply SDA/GA to chemical symbol space using SMILES fragments with recombination, mutation, and a heuristic stability function. Simulations show hallmark features of evolutionary search, including scaffold-level dominance, sustained novelty, and entropy reduction, yielding open-ended dynamics absent from equilibrium models with fixed transition rates. These results motivate an evolutionary ladder hypothesis where persistence-driven selection precedes genetic replication."}

Here we study a spiking multi-layer network alternating wake-like and deep-sleep-like states, with state-dependent dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity in a biologically inspired thalamo-cortical framework. During wakefulness, the model learns from few perceived examples, while during deep sleep it undergoes spontaneous replay driven by slow oscillations. Plasticity enabled not only within intra-layer connections, but also in inter-layer pathways, is critical for memory consolidation and energetic downshift. Compared to restricted plasticity, full inter-layer plasticity yields higher post-sleep visual classification accuracy and promotes the emergence of sharper class-specific associations. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysically grounded estimator of metabolic power expressing network energy consumption in ATP units, partitioned into baseline, synaptic maintenance, action potential, and transmission costs. We find that inter-layer plasticity in sleep leads to a larger reduction in firing rates, synaptic strength and synaptic activity, corresponding to a substantially larger decrease in power consumption. This work suggests promising elements to be integrated in neuromorphic/energy-efficient AI learning systems, supported by brain state-specific apical mechanisms."}

However, large scale studies on patient cohorts continue to rely on bulk transcriptomic data, where variation in tumor purity obscures tumor-intrinsic transcriptional signals and constrains downstream discovery. Many deconvolution methods report strong performance on synthetic bulk mixtures but fail to generalize to real patient cohorts because of unmodeled biological and technical variation.\n  Here, we introduce TwinPurify, a representation learning framework that adapts the Barlow Twins self-supervised objective, representing a fundamental departure from the deconvolution paradigm. Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as \"background\" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.\n  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles.

This paper shows that large neural nets are intrinsically unreliable, because it is not possible to make or validate a tractable theory of how a neural net works. There is no reliable way to extrapolate its performance from a limited number of test cases to an unlimited set of use cases. To have confidence in the performance of a neural net, it is necessary to enclose it in a guardrail which is provably safe, so that whatever the neural net does, there cannot be harmful consequences. World models have been proposed as a way to do this. This paper discusses the scope and architecture required of world models. World models are often conceived as models of the physical and natural world, using established theories of natural science, or learned regularities, to predict the physical consequences of AI actions. However, unforeseen consequences of AI actions impact the human social world as much as the physical world. To predict and control the consequences of AI, a world model needs to include a model of the human social world. I explore the challenges that this entails. Human language is based on a Common Ground of mutual understanding of the world, shared by the people conversing. The common ground is an overlapping subset of each persons world model, including their models of the physical, social and mental worlds. LLMs have no stable representation of a common ground. To be reliable, AI systems will need to represent a common ground with their users, including physical, mental and social domains."}

However, the effect of key experimental factors, including as eye state (open or closed) or stimulating coil size, remain unclear. As such, it is unknown whether these factors must be kept consistent across multi-center studies, and whether differences in such factors may underpin contradictory findings in existing literature.\n  Materials and Methods: Threshold tracking TMS was employed to measure RMT and SICI (3ms interstimulus interval, conditioning at 70% of RMT) in 21 alert and awake, healthy controls. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from abductor pollicis brevis. Both RMT and SICI were measured under 6 conditions, while eyes were open or closed, using 3 figure-of-eight coils of differing winding diameter. Mixed effects modelling was employed to investigate effects of eye state and coil size on each measure.\n  Results: RMT was found to be significantly higher for the smallest (30BFT) coil compared to both larger (50BFT and 70BF) coils. No difference in SICI was identified across coil sizes. Eye state was not found to affect either RMT or SICI measurements.\n  Conclusions: Measurements of RMT and SICI can be considered comparable if recorded with eyes open or closed, provided the individual is awake and alert. Measurements of SICI recorded with figure-of-eight coils of different size can be considered comparable."}

However, it has also been observed that the importance of this type of superspreading changes throughout an epidemic, generally in a decreasing manner as infections cascade from individuals with many contacts to those with fewer contacts. We provide an exact mathematical formulation of this phenomenon in strongly-immunizing (SIR) epidemics on static contact networks. Building on the edge-based modeling framework, we construct three metrics to track how superspreading changes through the course of an epidemic, respectively measuring infected nodes' contacts, exposures, and transmissions: (1) the mean degree of infected nodes, (2) the mean number of susceptible neighbors of infected nodes, and (3) the mean number of secondary cases that will be caused by newly infected nodes. We prove results about the behaviors of these metrics, highlighting the fact that their peak times all occur at less than half the time it takes for population-level infection prevalence to peak. This suggests that the importance of superspreading will be low when an epidemic is already near its peak, so contact-based control strategies are best employed as early in an outbreak as possible. We discuss implications for accurately measuring epidemiological parameters from incidence, mobility, contact tracing, and transmission data."}

Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology."}

Understanding the interplay between these mechanisms is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems and for informing sustainable management strategies. In this manuscript, we focus on a specific phenological adaptation: the ability of trees to enter summer dormancy once a critical temperature threshold is exceeded. Individuals are characterized by this threshold temperature and by their seed production capacity. We first establish a detailed mathematical model describing the population dynamics under these traits, and progressively reduce it to a system of two coupled ordinary differential equations. This simpler macroscopic model is then analyzed numerically, to investigate how the population reacts to a shift in its environment: an temperature increase, a drop in precipitation levels, or a combination of the two. Our results highlight contrasting effects of water stress and temperature stress on population dynamics, as well as the ambivalent effect of the plasticity."}

Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme. Finally, we perform a series of simulation studies in the Italian region of Lombardy (severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020) and in the US state of Georgia, in which we demonstrate the model's potential to better capture important spatiotemporal dynamics observed in real-world data compared to pure reaction-diffusion models."}
