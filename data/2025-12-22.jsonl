This first-of-its-kind study at such a scale uses machine learning to classify food processing levels (NOVA) based on the Open Food Facts dataset of over 900,000 products. Models including LightGBM, Random Forest, and CatBoost were trained on nutrient concentration data. LightGBM performed best, achieving 80-85% accuracy across different nutrient panels and effectively distinguishing minimally from ultra-processed foods. Exploratory analysis revealed strong associations between higher NOVA classes and lower Nutri-Scores, indicating poorer nutritional quality. Products in NOVA 3 and 4 also had higher carbon footprints and lower Eco-Scores, suggesting greater environmental impact. Allergen analysis identified gluten and milk as common in ultra-processed items, posing risks to sensitive individuals. Categories like Cakes and Snacks were dominant in higher NOVA classes, which also had more additives, highlighting the role of ingredient modification. This study, leveraging the largest dataset of NOVA-labeled products, emphasizes the health, environmental, and allergenic implications of food processing and showcases machine learning's value in scalable classification.

In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.\n  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57). Notably, SimBinder-IF trains only about 18 percent of the parameters of the full ESM-IF model, highlighting its parameter efficiency for high-affinity antibody generation."}

Yet the computational form of these biases and their neural implementation remain poorly understood. We introduce a framework that combines Graph Theory and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to formalize inductive biases as explicit, manipulable priors over structure and abstraction. Using a human behavioral dataset adapted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we show that differences in graph-based priors can explain individual differences in human solutions. Our method includes an optimization pipeline that searches over graph configurations, varying edge connectivity and node abstraction, and a visualization approach that identifies the computational graph, the subset of nodes and edges most critical to a model's prediction. Systematic ablation reveals how generalization depends on specific prior structures and internal processing, exposing why human like errors emerge from incorrect or incomplete priors. This work provides a principled, interpretable framework for modeling the representational assumptions and computational dynamics underlying generalization, offering new insights into human reasoning and a foundation for more human aligned AI systems."}

However, classical Petri net independence theory requires transitions to share no places -- a constraint that fails to capture biological reality. This mismatch prevents parallel simulation and incorrectly flags biologically valid models as structurally problematic.\n  Results: To resolve this fundamental limitation, we introduce weak independence -- a novel formalization distinguishing resource conflicts from biological coupling. Building on this theory, we extend the Bio-PN definition from a classical 5-tuple to a 12-tuple by adding regulatory structure, environmental exchange classification, dependency taxonomy, heterogeneous transition types, and biochemical formula tracking. This extended formalism enables systematic classification of three place-sharing modes: competitive (conflict), convergent (superposition), and regulatory (read-only). Validating our approach on 100 diverse BioModels (1,775 species, 2,234 reactions across metabolism, signaling, and gene regulation), we find that 96.93% of transition pairs exhibit weak independence -- confirming that biological networks inherently favor cooperation over competition. Our SHYpn implementation demonstrates the practical impact, achieving up to 2.6x speedup on 30% of evaluated models.\n  Availability and Implementation: Open-source at https://github.com/simao-eugenio/shypn (MIT License)."}

Using computational methods, we analyzed the lexical and structural divergence of 49 calendric lists from all major archipelagos, each containing about 30 night names. Our results, presented as a rooted phylogenetic tree, show a clear split into two main groups: one including lists from Rapa Nui, Mangareva, and the Marquesas; the other comprising lists from New Zealand, Hawaii, the Cook Islands, the Austral Islands, Tahiti, and the Tuamotu. This pattern aligns with a recent alternative classification of East Polynesian languages into 'Distal' (Marquesan, Mangarevan, Rapanui) and 'Proximal' (Maori, Hawaiian, Tahitian, etc.) subgroups. Since both language and lunar calendars are symbolic systems passed down and changed within communities - and given the geographic isolation of many archipelagos - we interpret this correspondence as evidence that the early divergence of East Polynesian lunar calendars mirrors early population movements and language splits in the region."}

We argue that a major bottleneck lies in tokenizing sparse and unevenly distributed DNA sequence motifs, which are critical for accurate and interpretable models. To investigate, we systematically benchmark k-mer and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers under controlled pretraining budget, evaluating across multiple downstream tasks from five datasets. We find that tokenizer choice induces task-specific trade-offs, and that vocabulary size and tokenizer training data strongly influence the biological knowledge captured. Notably, BPE tokenizers achieve strong performance when trained on smaller but biologically significant data. Building on these insights, we introduce DNAMotifTokenizer, which directly incorporates domain knowledge of DNA sequence motifs into the tokenization process. DNAMotifTokenizer consistently outperforms BPE across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that knowledge-infused tokenization is crucial for learning powerful, interpretable, and generalizable genomic representations."}

While this bistable behavior has been already observed in the past, the characterization of the statistical properties of avalanche activity and their temporal organization is still lacking, as well as a model able to reproduce these dynamics. Here, we analyze experimental data of human neuronal cultures with controlled percentage of inhibitory neurons and characterize their statistical properties and dynamical organization. In order to model the experimental data, we propose a novel version of the Kuramoto model for two populations of oscillators, excitatory and inhibitory, implementing successfully the inhibition dynamics. The model can fully reproduce the experimental results, confirming the existence of correlations in the temporal organization of avalanche activity and the presence of an amplification - attenuation regime, as found in the human brain."}

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues."}

Note: This manuscript is currently under review in \"Bulletin of Mathematical Biology\", submitted to the journal on 20 Nov, 2025", "summary": "We propose and analyze a model for antibiotic resistance transfer in a bacterial biofilm and examine antibiotic dosing strategies that are effective in bacterial elimination. In particular, we consider a 1-D model of a biofilm with susceptible, persistor and resistant bacteria. Resistance can be transferred to the susceptible bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically via conjugation. We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust."}

One key challenge is predicting future object motion in the presence of sensory uncertainty and inherent neural processing latencies. Theoretical frameworks such as internal models and optimal control have emphasized the role of predictive mechanisms in motor behavior. Active Inference extends these ideas by positing that perception and action arise from minimizing variational free energy under a generative model of the world. In this study, we investigate how different predictive strategies and the inclusion of environmental dynamics, specifically an internal model of gravity, influence interceptive control within an Active Inference agent. We simulate a simplified ball-catching task in which the agent moves a cursor horizontally to intercept a parabolically falling object. Four strategies are compared: short temporal horizon prediction of the next position or long horizon estimation of the interception point, each with or without a gravity prior. Performance is evaluated across diverse initial conditions using spatial and temporal error, action magnitude, and movement corrections. All strategies produce successful interception behavior, but those that incorporate gravity and longer temporal horizons outperform others. Including a gravity prior significantly improves spatial and temporal accuracy. Predicting the future interception point yields lower action values and smoother trajectories compared to short-horizon prediction. These findings suggest that internal models of physical dynamics and extended predictive horizons can enhance interceptive control, providing a unified computational account of how the brain may integrate sensory uncertainty, physical expectations, and motor planning."}

However, their security and robustness under adversarial manipulation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Secure Agentic Genomic Evaluator (SAGE), an agentic framework for auditing the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs. SAGE functions through an interpretable and automated risk auditing loop. It injects soft prompt perturbations, monitors model behavior across training checkpoints, computes risk metrics such as AUROC and AUPR, and generates structured reports with large language model-based narrative explanations. This agentic process enables continuous evaluation of embedding-space robustness without modifying the underlying model. Using SAGE, we find that even state-of-the-art GFMs like ESM2 are sensitive to targeted soft prompt attacks, resulting in measurable performance degradation. These findings reveal critical and previously hidden vulnerabilities in genomic foundation models, showing the importance of agentic risk auditing in securing biomedical applications such as clinical variant interpretation."}

Based on nonlinear phase map analysis of the above three brain regions using beta-phase connectivity, we found that: (1)Temporal-parietal phase clustering outperforms other regional combinations in distinguishing memory states; (2)Illumination-enhanced environments optimize temporoparietal balance;(3) Machine learning confirms temporal-parietal synchrony as the dominant cross-task classification feature. These results provide a precise prediction algorithm, facilitating a low-dimensional system using temporal and parietal EEG channels with practical value for real-time cognitive ergonomics assessment in BCIs and optimized human-machine interaction."}
