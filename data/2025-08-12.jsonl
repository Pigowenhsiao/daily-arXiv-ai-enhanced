The physical\napproach is an analysis of electrostatic interactions between ions and charges\non the DNA molecule. The coordination chemistry approach is a search for modes\nof direct binding of ions to ionophores of DNA. We study both the inner and\nouter sphere coordination of ions by ionophores of the A and C forms of DNA in\nmolecular dynamics simulations in two low-polarity solvents: in ethanol-water\nand methanol-water mixtures. We show that the counterion-DNA outer sphere\ncoordination plays a key role in the experimentally observed conformational\npolymorphism of the DNA molecule: a transition to the A form in ethanol and to\nthe C form in methanol. We identify the ionophores responsible for the\nexistence of the A- and C-complexes. In both the complexes, the ions' inner\nsphere ligands are mostly water molecules, the ions reside in water clusters.\nIn ethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are large, the major groove of the\nA-DNA is filled with water, and all ionophores are accessible to ions. In\nmethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are small, and a large number of\nmethanol clusters are present near DNA surface. They interfere with the\ncoordination of ions in one of the ionophores of the major groove, and also\nwith other ionophores near phosphates. Therefore, in methanol, the interaction\nenergy of counterions with A-DNA cannot compensate for the repulsion of closely\nlocated phosphates. Therefore, the ions fill more accessible ionophores of the\nC-complex, converting DNA into the C form."}

However, species can also emerge in continuous homogeneous environments\nthrough isolation by distance. When the environment is not homogeneous, natural\nselection contributes to differentiation by local adaptation and tends to\nfacilitate speciation. To explore how isolation by distance and adaptation\ncombine to determine species diversity, we implemented a model regulated by\nthese two components. The first is implemented via mating restrictions on\nspatial proximity and genetic similarity. The second is realized by an\necological phenotype subjected to adaption and natural selection. We consider\nscenarios where the environment is either homogeneous, with a single ecological\noptimum, or heterogeneous with two distinct optima. In homogeneous environments\nno speciation is observed under permissive mating restrictions, independent on\nthe strength of natural selection. On the other hand, if reproduction requires\nclose genetic similarity (strict mating restrictions), speciation occurs only\nunder strong selection. In contrast, in environments with two local optima and\nstrong selection, species well adapted to each of the niches emerge along the\nspatial structure, leading to the formation of groups with distinct phenotypes.\nPermissive mating restrictions leads to the formation of only two species, each\noccupying one of the niches; strong mating restriction leads to several species\nper niche, in a much faster speciation process. Interestingly, when selection\nis weak and reproduction requires strong genetic similarity, several species\nform, but the process is slow.

However, their effectiveness is limited when\nrelying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex\nstructures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two\ncomplementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological\nrelationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second\nemphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image\nview. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.\nTo leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes\n(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view\nintegration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly\nresampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids\nexcessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy\nexpansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's\nself-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the\nquality of the generated prefixes.

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The\nstage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature,\nsuggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages,\nwhile other unknown physical processes become dominant later on."}

By performing detailed analyses to identify\nthe reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information\nsubstantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration\nlayer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was\namplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally\nconstrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object\ninformation more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down\ninformation stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level.\nTogether, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding.\nOn the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit\nat the cost of more chaotic dynamics.
