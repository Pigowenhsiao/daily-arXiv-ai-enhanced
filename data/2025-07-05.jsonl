Through rigorous statistical methods, we identified a highly\nreduced set of 421 critical features. This set offers a novel perspective that\ncontrasts with traditional cancer driver genes, underscoring the potential for\nthese biomarkers in designing targeted therapies.

Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like\nImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001).

The invasion growth\nrates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of\nspecies when rare.

However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold\nin networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this\npresents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms\nin large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the\nbackbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools\nfor neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have\nbenefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning\nhas been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also\nconfer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity\nrecordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to\ndecode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to\ntest LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval\nzebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that\nLLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned\nfrom textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent\nmixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral\ndecoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided\nanatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.\nNLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide\nneural circuit dissection."}

In many\nnetworks, structural connectivity is not observable, which requires to be\ninferred via causal inference methods. Among them, transfer entropy (TE) is one\nof the most broadly applied causality measure due to its model-free property.\nHowever, TE often faces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional\nprobability estimation, and the relation between the inferred causal\nconnectivity and the underlying structural connectivity remains poorly\nunderstood. Here we address these issues by proposing a pairwise time-delayed\ntransfer entropy (PTD-TE) method. We theoretically establish a quadratic\nrelationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths, and demonstrate\nits immunity to dimensionality issues and broad applicability. Tests on\nbiological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and\nelectrophysiological data show PTD-TE achieves consistent, high-performance\nreconstructions.

However, the complexity of brain\nstructural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by\nsynaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly\nchallenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal\nrecordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and\nrequires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them\nunsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes.\nTo fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural\nchanges, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines\nconnectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed\ncorrelation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in\nbalanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes\nin structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time\nseries. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network\nusing spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show\nthe effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale\nnetwork simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method\naccommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic\ncoupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled\nsubnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in\nreal experimental situations.
