However, publicly releasing GWAS summary statistics poses well-recognized privacy risks, including the potential to infer an individual's participation in the study or to reveal sensitive phenotypic information (e.g., disease status). While differential privacy (DP) offers a rigorous mathematical framework for mitigating these risks, existing DP techniques for GWAS either introduce excessive noise or restrict the release to a limited set of results. In this work, we present practical DP mechanisms for releasing the complete set of genome-wide association statistics with privacy guarantees. We demonstrate the accuracy of the privacy-preserving statistics released by our mechanisms on a range of GWAS datasets from the UK Biobank, utilizing both real and simulated phenotypes. We introduce two key techniques to overcome the limitations of prior approaches: (1) an optimization-based randomization mechanism that directly minimizes the expected error in GWAS results to enhance utility, and (2) the use of personalized priors, derived from predictive models privately trained on a subset of the dataset, to enable sample-specific optimization which further reduces the amount of noise introduced by DP. Overall, our work provides practical tools for accurately releasing comprehensive GWAS results with provable protection of study participants."}

Current farming practices typically rear crickets in mixed-sex populations without automated sex sorting, despite potential benefits such as selective breeding, optimized reproduction ratios, and nutritional differentiation. This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying lightweight deep learning models on resource-constrained devices for insect farming applications, offering a practical solution to improve efficiency and sustainability in cricket production."}

Assembling the haplotypes of polyploid genomes remains a significant challenge due to the exponential search space of haplotype phasings and read assignment ambiguity; the latter challenge is particularly difficult for polyploid haplotype assemblers since the information contained within the observed sequence reads is often insufficient for unambiguous haplotype assignment in polyploid genomes. We present pHapCompass, probabilistic haplotype assembly algorithms for diploid and polyploid genomes that explicitly model and propagate read assignment ambiguity to compute a distribution over polyploid haplotype phasings. We develop graph theoretic algorithms to enable statistical inference and uncertainty quantification despite an exponential space of possible phasings. Since prior work evaluates polyploid haplotype assembly on synthetic genomes that do not reflect the realistic genomic complexity of polyploidy organisms, we develop a computational workflow for simulating genomes and DNA-seq for auto- and allopolyploids. Additionally, we generalize the vector error rate and minimum error correction evaluation criteria for partially phased haplotypes. Benchmarking of pHapCompass and several existing polyploid haplotype assemblers shows that pHapCompass yields competitive performance across varying genomic complexities and polyploid structures while retaining an accurate quantification of phase uncertainty.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication."}

The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions."}

Twitter was once an indispensable resource for tracking disease outbreaks and public sentiment in real time. Researchers used Twitter to monitor everything from influenza spread to vaccine hesitancy, demonstrating that social media data can serve as an early-warning system for emerging health threats. However, recent shifts in the social media landscape have challenged this data-driven paradigm. Platform policy changes, exemplified by Twitter's withdrawal of free data access, now restrict the very data that fueled a decade of digital public health research. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have dramatically expanded our capacity to analyze large-scale textual data across languages and contexts. This presents a paradox: we possess powerful new AI tools to extract insights from social media, but face dwindling access to the data. In this viewpoint, we examine how digital public health monitoring is navigating these countervailing trends. We discuss the rise of decentralized social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky as alternative data sources, weighing their openness and ethical alignment with research against their smaller scale and potential biases. Ultimately, we argue that digital public health surveillance must adapt by embracing new platforms and methodologies, focusing on common diseases and broad signals that remain detectable, while advocating for policies that preserve researchers' access to public data in privacy-respective ways."}

Bays", "Máté Lengyel"], "title": "Setting up for failure: automatic discovery of the neural mechanisms of cognitive errors", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions."}

However, expanding paleogenomic datasets indicate that damage patterns are more influenced by burial hydrology and microstructural context than by molecular age or ancestry. Fossils interact with their environments differently: some form closed, water-restricted compartments that preserve minimally damaged endogenous biomolecules, whereas others serve as open molecular reservoirs in which infiltrated environmental biomolecules undergo extensive deamination from repeated water exposure. Reliance on deamination alone can therefore suppress endogenous signals and complicate the interpretation of exogenous sequences. By introducing the molecular sedimentation model for fossil biomolecules, this Perspective outlines a source tracing framework that integrates fossil microstructure, ecological reference sets, and species-specific fragments to enable more reliable molecular inference across diverse depositional environments."}

In this study, 18 participants observed stimuli displayed in two conditions during the experiment: text-only (e.g., `Hit with a hammer') and video+text (visual clips with matching phrases). EEG data were recorded from 32 channels and analyzed for event-related potentials and source localization using LORETA, which identified four left-hemisphere regions of interest: the Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC), Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (pSTG), Ventral Premotor Cortex (PMv), and Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL). A space of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was constructed with driving inputs to LOC and pSTG, and multiple connectivity configurations were tested. Bayesian Model Selection revealed a dominant model in which PMv causally influenced IPL and pSTG, reflecting a feedforward architecture from affordance-related motor regions to semantic hubs. Bayesian Model Averaging further confirmed strong endogenous connections from LOC to PMv and IPL, and significant modulation from PMv to IPL. These findings provide direct evidence that affordance processing in premotor regions drives action language understanding by engaging downstream parietal and temporal areas. The results support grounded cognition theories and offer a mechanistic account of how sensorimotor information contributes to linguistic comprehension."}

Morphological observations of their endocranial structures allow for outlining some of the early steps of the evolutionary history of the cetacean brain. The external features of the brain and associated sinuses of Raoellidae are so far only documented by the virtual reconstruction of the endocast based on specimens of the species Indohyus indirae. These specimens are however too deformed to fully access the external morphology, surface area, and volume measurements of the brain. Methods: We bring here new elements to the picture of the raoellid brain by an investigation of the internal structures of an exceptionally well-preserved cranium collected from the Kalakot area (Jammu and Kashmir, India) referred to the species Khirtharia inflata. Micro-CT scan investigation and virtual reconstruction of the endocast and associated sinuses of this specimen provide crucial additional data about the morphological diversity within Raoellidae as well as reliable linear, surfaces, and volumes measurements, allowing for quantitative studies. Results: We show that, like I. indirae, the brain of K. inflata exhibits a mosaic of features observed in earliest artiodactyls: a small neocortex with simple folding pattern, widely exposed midbrain, and relatively long cerebellum. But, like Indohyus, the brain of Khirtharia shows unique derived characters also observed in stem cetaceans: narrow elongated olfactory bulbs and peduncles, posterior location of the braincase in the cranium, and complex network of blood vessels around the cerebellum. The volume of the brain relative to body mass of K. inflata is markedly small when compared to other early artiodactyls. Conclusion: We show here that cetaceans that nowadays have the second biggest brain after humans derive from a group of animals that had a lower-than-average expected brain size. This is probably a side effect of the adaptation to aquatic life. Conversely, this very small brain size relative to body mass might be another line of evidence supporting the aquatic habits in raoellids."}

However, understanding how neural population dynamics differ across regions and behavioral contexts remains challenging. Here, we surveyed neuronal population dynamics across multiple mouse brain areas (visual cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain) using spike data from local ensembles. Two complementary measures were used to characterize these dynamics: the coefficient of variation (CV), a classical indicator of spike-time variability, and statistical complexity, an information-theoretic quantifier of organizational structure. To probe stimulus-dependent activity, we segmented and concatenated recordings from behavioral experiments into distinct time series corresponding to natural image presentations, blank screens during visual task, and spontaneous activity. While the CV failed to discriminate between these conditions, statistical complexity revealed clear, stimulus-specific motifs in population activity. These results indicate that information-theoretic measures can uncover structured, stimulus-dependent patterns in neural population dynamics that remain unobserved in traditional variability metrics."}

The latter are typically used whenever the relationships cannot be adequately described by a tree, which happens when so-called reticulate evolutionary events happen, such as horizontal gene transfer or hybridization. But as such events are known to be relatively rare for most species, evolution is sometimes thought of as a process that can be represented by a tree with some additional edges, i.e., with a network that is still ``somewhat treelike''. In this context, different versions of so-called tree-based networks have played a major role in recent phylogenetic literature. Yet, surprisingly little is known about their combinatorial and graph-theoretic properties. In our manuscript, we answer a recently published question concerning the colorability of a specific class of tree-based networks. In particular, we will investigate an even more general class of graphs and show their 3-colorability. This nicely links recent phylogenetic concepts with classical graph theory."}

Furthermore, the authors of this study conjectured that every convex neural code can be realized as a minor of a neural code arising from a representable oriented matroid, which can lead to an equivalence between convex and polytope convex neural codes. Even though this conjecture has been confirmed in dimension two, its validity in higher dimensions is still unknown.
