These systems require models that can simultaneously\ncapture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across\nspatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,\nsuch as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.\nExisting geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either\nEuclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture\nboth the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware\ndependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large\nbiomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant\nNetwork that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and\nSpherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware\nfeatures. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a\nnovel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate\natomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling\nefficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.\nDualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing\nbenchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms\nprior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating\nits broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks."}

The classical\nRayleigh-Plateau instability concerns liquid jets governed by inertia and\nsurface tension, whereas biological tubes are membrane-bounded and\ninertia-free. We therefore refer to the process observed here as a pearling\ninstability, formally analogous to Rayleigh-Plateau but dominated by membrane\nmechanics. Although pearling-type instabilities have long been recognised in\nlipid tubes and some biological systems, a clear physiological example remained\nelusive. Here, we present results showing that pearling instability occurs\nduring the physiological process of platelet formation. Platelets are formed\nfrom megakaryocytes in the bone marrow by the extension of long protrusions,\ncalled proplatelets, that traverse the blood vessels. As they extend in the\nbloodstream, proplatelets become pearled and detach. Long and pearled\nproplatelets then circulate in the peripheral blood before their fragmentation\ninto calibrated platelets. We propose that this pearling, by creating regular\nconstrictions along the proplatelet, is key to the process of proplatelet\nfragmentation into individual platelets of calibrated size. Pearling\ninstability thus acts as a mechanobiological regulator allowing local delivery\nof the right size platelets to the right place at the right time. Our\nobservations quantitatively match parameter-free theoretical predictions for\nmembrane pearling, supporting a unified physical picture."}

However, the visual\nobservation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In\ndigital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and\nimaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in\nPapanicolaou-stained samples.

This paper proposes a novel\nPapanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key\nassumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of\nhematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain\nabundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity,\nweighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method\nachieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against\nthe results of multispectral imaging.
