Here, we survey emerging applications of explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI) to protein language models (pLMs) and describe\ntheir potential in protein research. We break down the workflow of a generative\ndecoder-only Transformer into four information contexts: (i) training\nsequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model architecture, and (iv) output\nsequence. For each, we describe existing methods and applications of XAI.\nAdditionally, from published studies we distil five (potential) roles that XAI\ncan play in protein design: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and\nTeacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one widely adopted so far.\nThese roles aim to help both protein science practitioners and model developers\nunderstand the possibilities and limitations of implementing XAI for the design\nof sequences. Finally, we highlight the critical areas of application for the\nfuture, including risks related to security, trustworthiness, and bias, and we\ncall for community benchmarks, open-source tooling, and domain-specific\nvisualizations to advance explainable protein design.

Numerous specialized equivariant\nnetworks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D\nmolecular graphs.

In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively\naddresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating\nrelative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million\nparameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model\nwith 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative\npositional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with\nthe shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different\nattention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional\nencoding technique in the NLP domain.

Assessing these could provide novel information for improved\ndiagnosis, prognosis, and treatment on an individual basis.\n  To estimate AV nodal conduction properties with beat-to-beat resolution, we\npropose a methodology comprising a network model of the AV node, a particle\nfilter, and a smoothing algorithm. The methodology was evaluated using\nsimulated data and using synchronized electrogram (EGM) and ECG recordings from\nfive patients in the intracardiac atrial fibrillation database. The\nmethodology's ability to quantify ANS-induced changes in AV node conduction\nproperties was evaluated by analyzing ECG data from 21 patients in AF\nundergoing a tilt test protocol.\n  The estimated refractory period and conduction delay matched the simulated\nground truth based on ECG recordings with a mean absolute error ($\\pm$ std) of\n169$\\pm$14 ms for the refractory period in the fast pathway; 131$\\pm$13 ms for\nthe conduction delay in the fast pathway; 67$\\pm$10 ms for the refractory\nperiod in the slow pathway; and 178$\\pm$28 ms for the conduction delay in the\nslow pathway.

However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical\nactivity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating\nwaves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's\ntwo-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local\ngeometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics,\ndespite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections\n(FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of\nactivity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by\ndeveloping a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which\ncortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional\nset of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the\nmodel across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales,\nwe demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of\nrapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\\lessapprox\n30~\\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous\nfluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\\text{ms}$), which increasingly\nresemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest\nthat the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local\n(geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are\ncontext-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture\nrapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid\nprocessing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping\nslower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic\nresonance imaging)."}
