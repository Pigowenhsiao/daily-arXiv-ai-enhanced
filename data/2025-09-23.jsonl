To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel\nGraph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph\nconstruction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification.\nTF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for\nconstructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a\ntensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal\ninteractions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency.

Material and Methods: This\nretrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private\ndataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE\n(T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model,\nRootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets.\nTraining was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was\nused to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method.\nSpinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with\nvertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis.\nResults: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults\n(mean age, 28.70 years $\\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females)\nachieved a mean $\\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\\pm$\n0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1\ncontrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively\nincreasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15\nmm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg\naccurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the\ndetermination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is\nopen-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including\nlesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group\nanalysis."}

We present a continuum model\nthat couples nutrient transport with the dynamics of proliferative bacteria,\npersisters, dead cells, and extracellular polymeric substances. The switching\nrates between proliferative and persister phenotypes depend on local nutrient\nconcentration through two thresholds, enabling adaptation across nutrient-poor,\nintermediate, and nutrient-rich regimes.

Flow diverters offer improved durability but rely on rigid metallic\nscaffolds that may malappose in tortuous vessels, compromise branch arteries,\ndelay endothelialization, and necessitate long-term dual antiplatelet therapy.\nThese shortcomings highlight a gap in current management: devices primarily\nprovide mechanical occlusion but fail to conform to complex geometries or\nreliably promote rapid, complete endothelialization.

This\napproach has driven breakthroughs across AI by allowing deep neural networks to\nlearn from massive, unstructured datasets. We use the term foundation models to\nrefer to large pretrained systems that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks\nwithin and across domains, and these models are increasingly applied beyond\nlanguage to the brain sciences. These models achieve strong predictive\naccuracy, raising hopes that they might illuminate computational principles.\nBut predictive success alone does not guarantee scientific understanding. Here,\nwe outline how foundation models can be productively integrated into the brain\nsciences, highlighting both their promise and their limitations. The central\nchallenge is to move from prediction to explanation: linking model computations\nto mechanisms underlying neural activity and cognition."}

However, in non-human primate\nneuroimaging studies, most ICA-recovered spatial maps are often dense. To\nextract the most relevant brain activation patterns, post-hoc thresholding is\ntypically applied-though this approach is often imprecise and arbitrary. To\naddress this limitation, we employed the Sparse ICA method, which enforces both\nsparsity and statistical independence, allowing it to extract the most relevant\nactivation maps without requiring additional post-processing. Simulation\nexperiments demonstrate that Sparse ICA performs competitively against 11\nclassical linear ICA methods. We further applied Sparse ICA to real non-human\nprimate neuroimaging data, identifying several independent component networks\nspanning different brain networks. These spatial maps revealed clearly defined\nactivation areas, providing further evidence that Sparse ICA is effective and\nreliable in practical applications."}

This attribution problem has become especially pressing with the rise\nof large language models and other advanced AI systems, where debates about \"AI\nconsciousness\" implicitly rely on some criterion for deciding whether a given\nsystem is conscious. In this paper, we propose a substrate-independent,\nlogically rigorous, and counterfeit-resistant sufficiency criterion for\nphenomenal consciousness. We argue that any machine satisfying this criterion\nshould be regarded as conscious with at least the same level of confidence with\nwhich we attribute consciousness to other humans. Building on this criterion,\nwe develop a formal framework and specify a set of operational principles that\nguide the design of systems capable of meeting the sufficiency condition. We\nfurther argue that machines engineered according to this framework can, in\nprinciple, realize phenomenal consciousness. As an initial validation, we show\nthat humans themselves can be viewed as machines that satisfy this framework\nand its principles. If correct, this proposal carries significant implications\nfor philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It offers an\nexplanation for why certain qualia, such as the experience of red, are in\nprinciple irreducible to physical description, while simultaneously providing a\ngeneral reinterpretation of human information processing. Moreover, it suggests\na path toward a new paradigm of AI beyond current statistics-based approaches,\npotentially guiding the construction of genuinely human-like AI."}

This work proposes a\nunified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending\nclassical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and\nhigher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel\non a finite simplicial complex $\\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals\non $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\\partial_k$. Computationally\nefficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed\nto implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology\ngeneralizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary\nstructure to localize topological features while maintaining homological\ninvariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement\nacross vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to\nparcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that\nsimplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying\ncoherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for\ncomputational neuroscience applications."}
