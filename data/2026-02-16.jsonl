This unique combination of characteristics seems to challenge the understanding that early loss of episodic memory may impede cognitive development and result in severe mental retardation. Although a few underlying mechanisms have been suggested, no computational model has been reported that is able to mimic the unique combination of characteristics. In this study, a cognitive system is presented, and developmental amnesia is demonstrated computationally in terms of impaired episodic recall, spared recognition and spared semantic learning. Impaired sequential/spatial learning ability of the hippocampus is suggested to be the cause of such amnesia. Simulation shows that impaired sequential leaning may only result in severe impairment of episodic recall, but affect neither recognition ability nor semantic learning. The spared semantic learning is inline with the view that semantic learning is largely associated with the consolidation of episodic memory, a process in which episodic memory may be mostly activated randomly, instead of sequentially. Furthermore, retrograded amnesia is also simulated, and the result and its mechanism are in agreement with most computational models of amnesia reported previously."}

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns)."}

Missing entries can degrade inferred topology and branch lengths, and generic matrix-completion methods may disrupt tree-like (ultrametric) structure.\n  Results: We propose Hyb-Adam-UM, which starts from an alignment-limited Needleman-Wunsch distance backbone and completes the matrix by minimizing a robust triplet ultrametric-violation functional. An Adam-style finite-difference optimizer updates only missing entries while enforcing symmetry, non-negativity, and a zero diagonal. From one complete reference matrix, we generate 20 masked instances at 30%, 50%, 65%, and 85% missingness. Hyb-Adam-UM consistently reduces ultrametric violations and achieves competitive reconstruction error, with improved topological accuracy and branch-length agreement relative to MW*/NJ* projection baselines (which exactly preserve observed distances) and Soft-Impute; gains are most pronounced at 85% missingness.\n  Availability and implementation: https://github.com/mitichya/hyb-adam-um/; Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18609748\n  Supplementary information: Supplementary data available online."}

ChemRecon enables unified querying, cross-database analysis, and the construction of graph-based representations of sets of related database entries by the traversal of inter-database connections. This facilitates information extraction which is impossible within any single database, including deriving consensus information from conflicting sources, of which identifying the most probable molecular structure associated with a given compound is just one example. The Python interface is available via pip from the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/chemrecon/).

Here, we propose RaSD (Randomized Synthesis and Disentanglement), a scalable framework for pre-training MIFMs entirely on synthetic data. By modeling anatomical structures and appearance variations with randomized Gaussian distributions, RaSD exposes models to sufficient multi-scale structural and appearance perturbations, forcing them to rely on invariant and task-relevant anatomical cues rather than dataset-specific textures, thereby enabling robust and transferable representation learning. We pre-trained RaSD on 1.2 million 3D volumes and 9.6 million 2D images, and extensively evaluated the resulting models across 6 imaging modalities, 48 datasets, and 56 downstream tasks. Across all evaluated downstream tasks, RaSD consistently outperforms training-from-scratch models, achieves the best performance on 17 tasks, and remains comparable to models pre-trained on large real datasets in most others. These results demonstrate that the capacity of synthetic data alone to drive robust representation learning. Our findings establish a paradigm shift in medical AI, demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a \"free lunch\" for scalable, privacy-preserving, and clinically generalizable foundation models."}
