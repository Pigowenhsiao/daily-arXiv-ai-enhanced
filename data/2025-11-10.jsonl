Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain\nnormalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by\nfragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight,\nopen-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI\npreprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation\nmanagement, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with\nmodern pathology foundation models.

Generative approaches promise\nfaster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,\nbut are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor\ngeneralisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from\nstructural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building\non this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion\nmodel that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within\nthe binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock\nexploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex\ndiffusion processes and unstable training dynamics.

Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is\ntrained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and\nsubstance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving\nthe area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the\ndepression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms\nthe effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the\nIntegrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key\nclinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal\ninflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific\nmedications and comorbidities.

When viewed in the space of\nall possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures\ncalled neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or\nduring sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond\nto continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons.\nClassical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors\ncan be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety\nof attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking\nnetwork connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated.\nHere, we address this question by using group representation theory to\nformalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and\nthe resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring\nmodel, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold.\nInterpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel\nwith feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we\nthen generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group\nrepresentation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant\nRNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group\nFourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a\nlow-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the\nsymmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results\nunderline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a\ngiven symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different\nsymmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle\npoints."}

A\ncharacteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time\nscale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among\nindividuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order\nto improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical\nmodel of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response.\nIn the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response\nleading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation\ninto memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the\nantibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal\ncenter reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell\ninto plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus\nis accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on\ninfection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational\nsimulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we\nanalyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides\nprotection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response\nin individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in\na broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times\nthat peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with\nmutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of\nthese virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose\nabout 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials."}

An open question is whether these dynamics govern MC\nactivity during brain-machine interface (BMI) control. We investigated MC\nactivity during BMI cursor movements of multiple durations, ranging from\nhundreds of milliseconds to sustained over seconds. These durations were chosen\nto cover the range of movement durations necessary to control modern BMIs under\nvarying precision levels.

Cognitive\nscreening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief\nsnapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by\ncontinuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether\nphysiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive\ntests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23\nolder adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess\nworking memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a\nwearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature,\nand movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and\nsegmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated\npredictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results:\nOur models showed strong performance with Spearman's \\rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean\nabsolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean\npredictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement\nand temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin\nconductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with\nskin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These\nfindings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised\nlearning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive\nfunctions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study\ndemonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This\napproach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions."}

Here we present a\nstudy of a laterally-inhibited network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons\nmodulated by a slow voltage-gated ion channel that acts as a linear adaptation\nvariable. As the strength of the ion channel increases, we find that its\ninteraction with the lateral inhibition increases wave speeds. The ion channel\ncan enable subthreshold oscillations, with the intervals between the firing\nevents of loosely-coupled travelling wave solutions structured around the\nneuron's natural period. These subthreshold oscillations also enable the\noccurrence of codimension-2 grazing bifurcations; along with the emergence of\nfold bifurcations along wave solution branches, the slow ion channel introduces\na variety of intermediate structures in the solution space.
