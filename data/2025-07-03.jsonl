To account for this property, gene\nexpression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical\nspecies are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic\nsimulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for\nrealistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise\nfor capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to\nspecialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more\naccessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of\nSSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm\nfor a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and\nprove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we\nuse the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights\nthe fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained\nby transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies\nthat may emerge from interactions between genes."}

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing.

We show that if trained with SGD,\ntwo EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will\nbecome Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will\nlearn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six\nways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence\nof the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of\nprogressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated\nphenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the\ntheory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent \"entropic\nforces\" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in\nrepresentation learning.
