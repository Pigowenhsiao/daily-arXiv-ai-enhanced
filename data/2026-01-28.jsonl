In post-bisulfite library construction, Adaptase-mediated tailing blurs the boundary between biological sequence and synthetic additions, rendering read trimming a persistent source of variability across analytical pipelines. We show that this variability reflects an intrinsic limit of per-read boundary inference rather than an algorithmic shortcoming: boundary localization is fundamentally asymmetric between paired-end reads, with Read 2 exhibiting kinetically structured artifacts that support constrained read-level inference, while apparent contamination in Read 1 arises conditionally from geometry-driven read-through events and is not well-defined at the single-read level. Even within Read 2, bisulfite-induced compositional degeneracy creates an indistinguishable regime in which genomic and synthetic origins share support under the same observable sequence evidence, implying a strictly positive Bayes error under any deterministic per-read decision rule and placing a fundamental limit on per-read boundary fidelity. By explicitly characterizing these limits, we reframe read trimming in ssWGBS as a constrained inference problem and introduce a conservative framework that operates only where supported by observable evidence (including short-range nucleotide texture), exposes interpretable trade-offs between genomic retention and residual artifact risk, and avoids forced resolution where boundaries are intrinsically unresolvable. Together, these results clarify why fixed trimming heuristics persist in practice and provide a principled foundation for uncertainty-aware preprocessing in ssWGBS."}

A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy."}

We present LvD, (Likelihood via Decomposition), an alternative to Felsenstein's algorithm based on a different decomposition of the underlying phylogeny. It works for all standard nucleotide models. The new algorithm allows updates of the likelihood calculation in worst case $O(\\log n)$ time with $n$ taxa, as opposed to worst case $O(n)$ time for existing methods. In practice this leads to appreciable improvements in likelihood calculations, the extent of speed-up depending on how balanced or unbalanced the trees are. We explore implications for parallel computing, and show that the approach allows likelihoods to be computed in $O(\\log n)$ parallel time per site, compared to (worst case) $O(n)$ time. We implemented and applied the algorithm to large numbers of simulated and empirical data sets and showed that these theoretical advances lead to a significant practical speed-up, although the extent of the improvement depends on how balanced the phylogenies already are."}

We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects."}

Currently, generative models dominate functional protein design but cannot model pocket-substrate interactions, which limits the generation of enzymes with precise catalytic environments. To address this issue, we propose EnzyPGM, a unified framework that jointly generates enzymes and substrate-binding pockets conditioned on functional priors and substrates, with a particular focus on learning accurate pocket-substrate interactions. At its core, EnzyPGM includes two main modules: a Residue-atom Bi-scale Attention (RBA) that jointly models intra-residue dependencies and fine-grained interactions between pocket residues and substrate atoms, and a Residue Function Fusion (RFF) that incorporates enzyme function priors into residue representations. Also, we curate EnzyPock, an enzyme-pocket dataset comprising 83,062 enzyme-substrate pairs across 1,036 four-level enzyme families. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EnzyPGM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EnzyPock. Notably, EnzyPGM reduces the average binding energy of 0.47 kcal/mol over EnzyGen, showing its superior performance on substrate-specific enzyme design. The code and dataset will be released later."}

Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations."}

Despite their central role in cognition, the computational principles and neural mechanisms supporting schema formation and use remain elusive. Here, we introduce schema-based hierarchical active inference (S-HAI), a novel computational framework that combines predictive processing and active inference with schema-based mechanisms. In S-HAI, a higher-level generative model encodes abstract task structure, while a lower-level model encodes spatial navigation, with the two levels linked by a grounding likelihood that maps abstract goals to physical locations. Through a series of simulations, we show that S-HAI reproduces key behavioral signatures of rapid schema-based generalization in spatial navigation tasks, including the ability to flexibly remap abstract schemas onto novel contexts, resolve goal ambiguity, and balance reuse versus accommodation of novel mappings. Crucially, S-HAI also reproduces prominent neural codes reported in rodent medial prefrontal cortex during a schema-dependent navigation and decision task, including task-invariant goal-progress cells, goal-identity cells, and goal-and-spatially conjunctive cells, as well as place-like codes at the lower level. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic account of schema-based learning and inference that bridges behavior, neural data, and theory. More broadly, our findings suggest that schema formation and generalization may arise from predictive processing principles implemented hierarchically across cortical and hippocampal circuits, enabling the generalization of experience."}

These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a \"holy grail\" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable?

In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.

However, there are many information gaps about vehicle movements patterns that increase the probability of disease transmission, which is crucial in developing better preventive strategies. In this study we described the movement pattern of vehicle cabs and trailers and identified risk factors for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) farm's infectious status. We collected global positioning system (GPS) movement data from vehicle cabs and trailers for 18 months and basic information for 6621 farms in the U.S. For the vehicle movement data, we estimated 66 variables and evaluate their association with farms PRRS and PED status. Our univariate analysis showed that 56 variables were significant associated (p < 0.05) to PED and PRRS farm status. Within these variables, vehicle visit frequency and previous exposition to positive farms were the main risk factors for both diseases. Otherwise, increased vehicle cab and trailer loyalty for farm shipments and vehicle cleaning and disinfection events were protective factors. In the multivariate model, each additional weekly visit by a vehicle cab that had been exposed to a positive farm one day before the shipment was associated with a 234\\% and 243\\% increase in the odds of a farm testing PRRS- and PED-positive, respectively. Our analysis revealed that vehicle contact history play a crucial role in the transmission of PRRS and PED. These findings can provide insights to develop more target strategies aimed at reducing the transmission and outbreaks linked to vehicle movements in swine production."}

Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.\n  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli.\n  By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics."}

We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions."}
