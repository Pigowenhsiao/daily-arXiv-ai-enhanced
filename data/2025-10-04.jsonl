We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and\ncorresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT),\nsyncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations.\nBeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $\\mu$M) or an oxyquinoline\nderivative (OD, 5 $\\mu$M) to induce hypoxia.

Prior works have investigated representational alignment between\nartificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings\nare indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations\nthemselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features\nfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.\nThis leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual\ninformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,\nand whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful\nsubspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages\nthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the\nvisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first\nuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent\nsubspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information\n(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific\nvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on\nmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of\ntwo macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies\nneural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual\nfeatures, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and\nintra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of\nstructured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our\nunderstanding of its encoding principles."}

Our model successfully recovers ground\ntruth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks.

In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is\nproposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical\nconflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory\nconflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing\nthe algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.\n  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion\nsettings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure\nspecific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and\nmotion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no\nmotion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator\nwith participants exposed to passive driving.\n  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model\npredictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the\nlowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The\ncompromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)\ncompared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force\ntracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.\n  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the\nsimulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant\nadvancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific\nforce recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use."}

Here, by considering functional inter-individual\nvariability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an\nenhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)\nextraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs\nself-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional\ninter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that\ngenerates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the\nabsence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel\naugmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,\nVarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series\nprocessing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our\nVarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject\nfingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii)\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the\nABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our\nextensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning\nmethods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and\ngeneralizability.

However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with\nstrong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most\ndata-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and\nstill suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods\navoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median\n(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M\nintroduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent\nsub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional\ninterpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values\ndistorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling\nspace and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is\nemployed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for\nNoise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par\nwith state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently\noutperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an\nefficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the\nfirst step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.\nassumption."}
