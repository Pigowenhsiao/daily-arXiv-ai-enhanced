This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to\nobtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted\nparticipants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy\nparticipants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15\nMETH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power\n(RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31\nchannels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically,\nMAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as\nindicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma\nRBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT\nand HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is\nlower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be\nvalidated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the\nTP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when\nreceiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to\nMETH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and\nHC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time\nmonitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for\nimplementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH\naddiction."}

Mathematical models significantly\ncontribute to this by providing a theoretical framework to understand the\ncomplex interactions between cancer stem cells, differentiated cancer cells,\nand immune system components. Such models depend on experimental data and\ncomputational simulations to predict tumor dynamics, offering insights into how\ndifferent cell populations evolve over time. However, to ensure their realistic\nand consistent outcomes, rigorous mathematical analysis is required, including\nverification of solution uniqueness, stability, viability, positivity, and\nboundedness. Such validation guarantees that model's results can be used in\nboth oncological research and clinical applications. In this study, we conduct\na comprehensive analysis of an integrative mathematical model of cancer cell\ndifferentiation, with a particular focus on its interactions with immune cells.\nThe model captures the dynamic balance between cancer stem cell self-renewal,\ndifferentiation into mature tumor cells, and immune-mediated elimination. By\nemploying analytical and numerical techniques, we assess the model's\nfeasibility, stability, and long-term behavior under various biological\nconditions. Our findings demonstrate that immune system engagement can\nsignificantly influence tumor composition and growth, highlighting potential\ntherapeutic targets.

Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for treatment planning,\nsurgical guidance, and monitoring disease progression, yet manual segmentation\nis time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in\ndeep learning, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers\nhave demonstrated significant potential in automating this critical task. This\nstudy evaluates three state-of-the-art architectures, SwinUNETR-v2, nnUNet, and\nMedNeXt for automated brain tumor segmentation in multi-parametric Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We trained our models on the BraTS-Africa 2024\nand BraTS2021 datasets, and performed validation on the BraTS-Africa 2024\nvalidation set. We observed that training on a mixed dataset (BraTS-Africa 2024\nand BraTS2021) did not yield improved performance on the SSA validation set in\nall tumor regions compared to training solely on SSA data with well-validated\nmethods. Ensembling predictions from different models also lead to notable\nperformance increases.

This simplistic assumption prevents models from\naccurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,\nparticularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely\nhindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The\nphysically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive\nalternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To\ndate, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and\noperational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.\nHere, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann\nMachine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum\nprocessor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its\nuse as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to\nmillion-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates\na latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,\nconsistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models\nlike VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type\nclassification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of\nintroducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire\nscientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations.
