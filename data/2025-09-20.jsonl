One common challenge is the ability to\noptimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of\nDNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and\nantimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely\non simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than\nhigh-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a\ngeometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which\nlearns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property\nspace. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold\nthat can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an\nappropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide\nthe sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder\nlayers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized\nlatent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired\nproperties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our\nframework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template\nfluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The\ntrained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent\nspace according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ\nsampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to\n16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance\nin training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework."}

The\nfirst claim is that the dynamics of change in an Ising like attitude network,\nunder perturbation of any one single node, can be inferred from the static\nnetwork attributes of said node. The second claim is that psychological network\nmodels of attitudes with Ising like dynamics will maximize both attitudinal\nconsistency and accuracy when within the small world topological regime. The\nfirst claim, one with significant application potentials, has not been\nsufficiently tested; the second claim, one with high theoretical novelty, has\nnever been addressed.

Inspired by\nthis gap, we propose the Mouse vs. AI: Robust Foraging Competition, a novel\nbioinspired visual robustness benchmark to test generalization in reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agents trained to navigate a virtual environment toward a\nvisually cued target. Participants train agents to perform a visually guided\nforaging task in a naturalistic 3D Unity environment and are evaluated on their\nability to generalize to unseen, ecologically realistic visual perturbations.\nWhat sets this challenge apart is its biological grounding: real mice performed\nthe same task, and participants receive both behavioral performance data and\nlarge-scale neural recordings (over 19,000 neurons across visual cortex) for\nbenchmarking. The competition features two tracks: (1) Visual Robustness,\nassessing generalization across held-out visual perturbations; and (2) Neural\nAlignment, evaluating how well agents' internal representations predict mouse\nvisual cortical activity via a linear readout. We provide the full Unity\nenvironment, a fog-perturbed training condition for validation, baseline\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) agents, and a rich multimodal dataset.

LLMs represent words and\nphrases as high-dimensional numerical vectors that encode vast semantic\nknowledge. To harness this potential for cognitive science, we introduce\nVECTOR, a computational framework that aligns LLM representations with human\ncognitive map organisation.

While\nnetwork-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of\nfeature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains\nunderexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each\nconstructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct\ncombinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be\nrepresentative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these\nmodels through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with\nrespect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their\nstructural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler,\nfeature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex,\nmultidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These\nresults support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive\nnetworks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and\nfree energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are\nstructurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both\nuncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a\nfew frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate\nbetween stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive\ndynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These\nfindings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in\nmusic observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation\nshape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures\nevolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of\nnetwork science."}

Yet, in modern\nmachine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can\nhelp improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable\nmodel of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data\ncoarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics,\nwe analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based\non their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic\ndependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A\n'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can\nhelp models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates\nout more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially,\nusing optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a\ndistinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent.\nOur framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data\naugmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and\nisolates more predictive signals.
