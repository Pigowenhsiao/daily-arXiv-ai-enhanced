It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water'' system under physiological conditions."}

This study examined three components of creativity-divergent thinking, cognitive reflection, and insight in a large sample (N = 5,905) from the Great British Intelligence Test. We compared performance between individuals with past psychedelic use and those without such use. Psychedelic users scored significantly higher on divergent thinking than both non-drug users and drug users who had not used psychedelics.

In simple systems such as $\\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis."}

Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate, patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features. To address these challenges, we combined image registration with finite element method (FEM) to enhance AV tracking and biomechanical assessment. Patient-specific valve geometries from 4D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CT were used in FEM to model AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. The FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while the registration algorithm corrected mismatches between simulation and image. Across 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration (33% for TEE, 46% for CT). This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties from boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal and Green-Lagrange strains, as well as effective strain, were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid, and pediatric patients. Trileaflet adults showed uniform deformation, BAVs exhibited asymmetric strain, and pediatric valves had low mean areal strain with high variability. Convergence between trileaflet adult and pediatric valves in mean effective strain suggests volumetric deformation drives age- and size-related differences. The FEM-augmented registration framework enhances geometric tracking and provides clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation, supporting individualized intervention planning."}

Recent experiments and theoretical studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of T-type and L-type calcium currents in shaping the activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. However, the role of these currents in the generation of synchronized activity patterns in BG networks involving STN is still unknown. In this study, using an STN model incorporating T-type and L-type calcium currents, we examined how these currents shape the patterns of neural activity in the subthalamo-pallidal network, including network dynamics in response to periodic external inputs. The dynamics were studied in relation to the network connectivity parameters - modulated by dopamine (depleted in PD's BG) - and compared with the properties of the temporal patterning of synchronous neural activity previously observed in the experimental studies with Parkinsonian patients. Stronger T-type current enhanced post-inhibitory rebound bursting and expanded synchronized rhythmic activity, reducing the range of intermittent synchrony and increasing resistance to external entrainment. Stronger L-type current prolonged STN bursts, promoted intermittent synchrony over a wide range of input amplitudes, and sustained beta oscillations, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of PD. These results highlight the interplay between intrinsic cellular properties, synaptic parameters, and external inputs in shaping pathological synchronized rhythms in BG networks. Understanding these network mechanisms may advance the understanding of Parkinsonian rhythmogenesis and further assist in finding ways to modulate and suppress pathological rhythms."}

Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation."}

An aspect of these analyses is determining which receptors expand or contract statistically significantly as a function of an exogenous perturbation such as therapeutic intervention. We characterize the commonly used Fisher's exact test approach for such analyses and propose an alternative formulation that does not necessitate pairwise, within-patient comparisons. We develop this flexible Bayesian longitudinal mixture model that accommodates variable length patient followup and handles missingness where present, not omitting data in estimation because of structural practicalities. Once clones are partitioned by the model into dynamic (expanding or contracting) and static categories, one can associate their counts or other characteristics with disease state, interventions, baseline biomarkers, and patient prognosis. We apply these developments to a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent randomized metastasis-directed therapy or not. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in clonal expansions among MDT patients and their association with later progressions both independent and within strata of MDT. Analysis of receptor motifs and VJ gene enrichment combinations using a high-dimensional penalized log-linear model we develop also suggests distinct biological characteristics of expanding clones, with and without inducement by MDT."}

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making."}

This disease can spread either via large droplets through direct social contacts, which we associate with edges (i.e., hyperedges of size 2), or via infected aerosols in the environment through hyperedges of size at least 3 (i.e., polyadic interactions).

Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers."}

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence."}

Yet, most wastewater-based epidemiology methods, which use wastewater surveillance results for disease inferences, implicitly assume that individuals excrete only at their residential locations and that the population contribute to wastewater samples are static. These simplifying assumptions ignore daily mobility, social interactions, and heterogeneous toilet use behavior patterns, which can lead to biased interpretation of wastewater results, especially at upstream sampling locations such as neighborhoods, institutions, or buildings. Here, we introduce an agent-based geospatial simulation framework: Building on an established Patterns of Life model, we simulate daily human activities, mobility, and social contacts within a realistic urban environment and extend this agent-based framework with a physiologically motivated defecation cycle and toilet usage patterns. We couple this behavioral model with an infectious disease model to simulate transmissions through spatial and social interactions. When a defecation occurs for an infected agent, we use a pathogen shedding model to determine the amount of pathogen shed in the feces. Such a framework, integrating population mobility, disease transmission, toilet use behavior, and pathogen shedding models, is capable to simulate the Spatial-temporal dynamics of wastewater signals for a city. Using a case study of 10,000 simulated agents in Fulton County, Georgia, we examine how varying infection rates alter epidemic trajectories, pathogen loads in wastewater, and the spatial distribution of contamination across time."}

The SCN is divided into two subgroups of oscillating cells: the ventro-lateral (VL) neurons, which are exposed to light (photic signal) and the dorso-medial (DM) neurons which are coupled to the VL cells. When the coupling between these neurons is strong enough, the system synchronizes with the photic period. Upon increasing the cell coupling, the entrainment of the DM cells has been recently shown to occur via a very sharp (jumping) transition when the period of the photic input is larger than the intrinsic period of the cells. Here, we characterize this transition with a simple realistic model. We show that two bifurcations possibly lead to the disappearance of the endogenous mode. Using a mean field model, we show that the jumping transition results from a supercritical Hopf-like bifurcation. This finding implies that both the period and strength of the stimulating photic signal, and the relative fraction of cells in the VL and DM compartments are crucial in determining the synchronization of the system."}

In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.\n  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.\n  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).\n  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source."}

We present a novel network reconstruction framework that generates MSM sexual contact networks from individual-level behavioral data, incorporating clustering and demographic assortativity by age, race, and sexual activity. Using data from 4667 MSM participants, we reconstructed networks with varying topological properties and simulated HIV transmission over 50 years. Network structure strongly influenced outcomes: assortative by degree networks showed 18% lower equilibrium prevalence (63% vs 80% in assortative by race networks) due to hub isolation within communities. Targeted PrEP strategies based on degree or k-shell centrality achieved similar reductions with 20 to 40% coverage, matching random allocation at 60 to 80% coverage, particularly in assortative by age and race networks where hubs bridge demographic groups. Empirical PrEP distribution was suboptimal, underperforming by up to 30% compared with network-based strategies.

While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes."}

Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly."}
