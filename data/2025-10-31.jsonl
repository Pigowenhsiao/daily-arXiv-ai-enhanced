For example, Markov models for ion\nchannels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for \"slow\"\nand \"fast\" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool\nin the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing\nmodel states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,\neach individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct\nbiophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models\nand discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the\naggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using\nP\\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states\nthat exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.\nWe will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate\nnon-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable\nfully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of\nnon-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue\nthat instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct\nbiophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to\nbuild models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight\ninto the dynamics of conformational changes."}

This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid\nsurface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated,\ncondensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of\nwetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and\ndiffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical\nunderpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key\nphenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from\nasymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid\npenetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to\nchanges in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous)\nrotational symmetry-breaking on energetics.

This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy\nindirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this\nwork, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates\nsequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry\nenvironmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.\nIn this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are\neasy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as\nfollows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset\ncontaining 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond\ncleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million\nlabeled data based on MiPD513.

By employing a multitype branching\nprocess, the stochastic threshold for rabies persistence was determined,\nrevealing important insights into how stochasticity influences extinction\nprobabilities. The stochastic model utilized 10,000 sample paths to estimate\nthe probabilities of rabies outbreaks, offering a rigorous assessment of the\nvariability in disease occurrences.

These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as\nbuilding blocks for integrating information both within and across brains.
