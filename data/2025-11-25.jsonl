We propose a neural network architecture incorporating Fourier Transform analysis to process trajectory data, achieving dual objectives: eliminating high-frequency noise while preserving biologically critical slow conformational dynamics, and establishing an isotropic representation space through the last hidden layer for enhanced dynamical quantification. Comparative protein simulations demonstrate our approach generates more uniform feature distributions than linear regression methods, evidenced by smoother state similarity matrices and clearer classification boundaries. Moreover, by using saliency score, we identified key structural determinants linked to effective energy landscapes governing system dynamics. We believe that the fusion of neural network features with physical order parameters creates a robust analytical framework for advancing biomolecular trajectory analysis."}

The aggregation behaviour in vitro is well understood and driven by the equilibration of a super-saturated protein solution to its aggregated equilibrium state. However, the situation is altered fundamentally in living systems where active processes consume energy to remove aggregates. It remains unclear how and why cells transition from a state with predominantly monomeric protein, which is stable over decades, to one dominated by aggregates. Here, we develop a simple but universal theoretical framework to describe cellular systems that include both aggregate formation and removal. Using a two-dimensional phase-plane representation, we show that the interplay of aggregate formation and removal generates cell-level bistability, with a bifurcation structure that explains both the emergence of disease and the effects of therapeutic interventions. We explore a wide range of aggregate formation and removal mechanisms and show that phenomena such as seeding arise robustly when a minimal set of requirements on the mechanism are satisfied. By connecting in vitro aggregation mechanisms to changes in cell state, our framework provides a general conceptual link between molecular-level therapeutic interventions and their impact on disease progression."}

Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation."}

These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation."}

Some species show high levels of socio-cognitive abilities that enable them to perceive communicational gestures of humans and use them for their own benefit. This study investigated the ability of Indian free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) to utilise human social-referential cues (pointing and gazing) to locate hidden food, focusing on the relative effectiveness of unimodal versus multimodal cues. A total of 352 adult free-ranging dogs were tested in an object-choice task involving six different cue conditions: control (no cue), negative control (one baited bowl, no cue), combined pointing and gazing, pointing-only, gazing-only, and conflicting cues (pointing and gazing at opposite bowls). The dogs successfully chose the correct target only in the combined pointing and gazing condition, while performance under unimodal and conflicting cue conditions did not differ significantly from chance. This highlights the importance of signal redundancy and clarity in interspecific communication for this population. A dog's demeanor was a significant predictor of its willingness to engage: affiliative dogs were significantly more likely to succeed in the overall experiment and displayed a significantly shorter approach latency compared to anxious and neutral dogs. While demeanor affected the approach latency, it did not affect the accuracy of the choice, decoupling the dogs' personality from its cognitive ability to comprehend the clear cue.

The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack."}

ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment.

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes.

Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.

However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.\n  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.\n  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications."}

Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation."}

As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea). The mathematical and algorithmic results are accompanied by software enabling the routine analysis of autocatalysis in large CRNs."}

Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.\n  Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability."}

We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings.

Conventional analyses of gene expression often rely on thresholded correlation networks or clustering-based module detection, approaches that may obscure nonlinear structure and higher-order organization. Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis.

While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy."}

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity."}

Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects."}

Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning."}

This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.\n  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.\n  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency.
