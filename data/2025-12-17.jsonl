However, they typically neglect neuromodulatory agents that are known to strongly shape memory capacity and stability. Here we introduce a minimal, biophysically motivated associative memory network where neuropeptide-like signals are modeled by a self-adaptive, activity-dependent gating mechanism. Using many-body simulations and dynamical mean-field theory, we show that such gating fundamentally reorganizes the attractor structure: the network bypasses the classical spin-glass transition, maintaining robust, high-overlap retrieval far beyond the standard critical capacity, without shrinking basins of attraction. Mechanistically, the gate stabilizes transient ghost remnants of stored patterns even far above the Hopfield limit, converting them into multistable attractors. These results demonstrate that neuromodulation-like gating alone can dramatically enhance associative memory capacity, eliminate the sharp Hopfield-style catastrophic breakdown, and reshape the memory landscape, providing a simple, general route to richer memory dynamics and computational capabilities in neuromodulated circuits and neuromorphic architectures."}

Accurately predicting transitions to anesthetic drugs overdosage is a critical challenge in general anesthesia as it requires the identification of EEG indicators relevant for anticipating the evolution of the depth of anesthesia. Methods. In this study, we introduce a real-time, data-driven framework based on alpha spindle dynamics extracted from frontal EEG recordings. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition, we segment transient alpha spindle events and extract statistical features such as amplitude, duration, frequency, and suppression intervals. We apply these features to train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine, LGBM, classifier on a clinical EEG dataset spanning induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of general anesthesia. Results. Our model accurately classifies anesthesia phases with over 80 percent accuracy and anticipates the onset of isoelectric suppression, a marker of anesthetic drugs overdosage, with 96 percent accuracy up to 90 seconds in advance. Conclusion. The spindle-based metrics provides a non-invasive, interpretable, and predictive approach. This real-time method can be used to forecast unintentional anesthetic drugs overdosage, enabling proactive anesthesia management based solely on EEG signals. Significance. This new method is the first to provide a way to prevent too deep anesthesia and its consequence for the well-being of patients after the recovery from anesthesia."}

Hummel"], "title": "Temporal interference stimulation for deep brain neuromodulation in humans", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "eess.SY"], "comment": null, "summary": "For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment."}

Journal submission undergoing peer review", "summary": "We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice."}

To this end, we propose an improved inverse method for estimating time-varying transmission rates in low-prevalence settings, where conventional data preprocessing approaches often fail due to sparse case observations. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an exponential B-spline interpolation approach that integrates both continuous and discrete inverse methods. This method ensures that transmission rate estimates remain non-negative and smooth, even when the observed data exhibit low cases. We apply this approach to several infectious disease models using real-world data from China, including a scarlet fever model, a multi-strain influenza model, and an age-structured influenza model. The results show that our method provides accurate transmission rate estimates, particularly in low-prevalence infectious diseases and multi-group epidemic models, demonstrating its robustness and applicability across various epidemiological contexts. The improved inverse method offers a new perspective for epidemiological modeling and provides reliable technical support for related theoretical exploration and public health decision-making."}

Traditional metrics such as ``time under tension'' are fundamentally insufficient, because they are scalar quantities that ignore the temporal history of deviations, that is, the microdynamics of posture, which has nontrivial energetic consequences. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded methodology to address this problem by introducing the concept of the \\textbf{deviation absement} ($Δ\\mathcal{A}_\\ell$), defined as the time integral of the deviation of the muscle--tendon unit length from a reference value.\n  We rigorously prove that, for a broad class of quasi-static models, absement appears as the leading first-order state variable. For small deviations in a neighbourhood of a reference posture, the total metabolic cost $\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{met}}(\\ell)$ admits a universal asymptotic expansion of the form \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{met}}(\\ell) = P_0 T + C_1 Δ\\mathcal{A}_\\ell + C_2 \\int_0^T(\\ell(t)-\\ell_0)^2\\,dt + O(\\|\\ell-\\ell_0\\|_{L^\\infty}^3), \\end{equation*} where $T$ is the duration of loading, and $P_0, C_1, C_2$ are constants determined by local properties of the system.\n  Thus, the deviation absement ($Δ\\mathcal{A}_\\ell$) is the \\textbf{unique first-order sufficient statistic} that allows one to quantify and separate the energetic contribution of systematic drift of the mean posture from the contribution of micro-oscillations (tremor), which is described by the quadratic term. This result has direct consequences for parameter identification: the proposed formalism makes it possible to recover physically meaningful coefficients $(P_0, C_1, C_2)$ by means of linear regression of experimental data obtained from standard kinematic measurements and indirect calorimetry."}

Classic models such as the Moran process capture stochastic birth-death dynamics in structured populations, while reaction-diffusion equations like the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation describe deterministic wave-like spread. In this work, we bridge these perspectives by deriving partial differential equations for the spatiotemporal limit of Moran dynamics in continuous media. Our model incorporates two distinct fitness components: fecundity (birth rate) and viability (death rate). We demonstrate that the resulting selective wave speeds differ substantially in spatial Moran Birth-death (Bd), Moran Death-birth (Db), and FKPP dynamics. When fecundity drives the dynamics, we observe that the selective waves decelerate for the Bd process, whereas in the Db process the wave propagates with a higher, constant speed. In contrast, when viability drives the process, the Db wave accelerates, while the Bd and FKPP waves maintain comparable constant speeds. We extend the framework to heterogeneous media, represented as weighted lattice graphs in one or two dimensions. We derive a continuous space analog of isothermal graphs and establish that the isothermality condition corresponds to the conservation of a local current."}

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery."}

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses."}

These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available.
