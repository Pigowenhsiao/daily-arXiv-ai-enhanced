This review\nexplores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in\naddressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss\nhistorical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark\ncreation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a\nspecial focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate\nthe sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we\nexamine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards\nfunctionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like\nactive site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating\nstructural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based\nstrategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite\nsignificant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has\nbeen proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating\nfunctionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise\nfunctionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that\nsimultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both\nphysical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental\ninsights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme\ndesign and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein\nbiochemistry, biophysics, and design."}

Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained\nneural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To\nensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a\npopulation-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation.

We address this problem by proposing a parsimonious network of\nQuadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with sequences embedded via a\ntemporally asymmetric Hebbian (TAH) rule. Our findings demonstrate that this\nsingle framework robustly reproduces a spectrum of sequential activities,\nincluding persistent synfire-like chains and transient, hippocampal replay-like\nbursts exhibiting intra-ripple frequency accommodation (IFA), all achieved\nwithout requiring specialized delay or adaptation mechanisms.

We implement this framework using a model of pest movement governed by\ntrap crop attractiveness, the potential yield threatened by pests, and\nfunctional relationships between yield loss and pest density drawn from the\nliterature. Focusing on a simple case in which pests move freely across the\nfield and are attracted to traps solely by their relative attractiveness, we\nfind that allocating 5-20 percent of the landscape to trap plants is typically\nrequired to maximize yield and achieve effective pest control in the absence of\npesticides. For highly attractive trap plants, growers can devote less space\nbecause they are more effective; less attractive plants are ineffective even in\nlarge numbers.

In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method\nof functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary\nbrain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple\nbase machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in\nposterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the\nrange [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach\nto seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject\nRelease), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social\ncognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean\nincident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression\nclassifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%.

For the kinetics equations of the\ncomplete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine\nphase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both\ntime-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current.
