Here, employing a custom interpretable deep learning framework (CARSS) on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identify CD34$^{+}$PDGFR$α$$^{+}$ telocytes (CPTCs) as the primary mechanosensors in both fascia and colon during bacterial colitis. We show that somatic mechanotherapy triggers an AP-1/Hsp70-dependent transcriptional program in fascial CPTCs, inducing systemic Wnt elevation, which elicits a \"transcriptional resonance\" in colonic CPTCs, reprogramming their communication network from an inflammatory amplifier to a Wnt-driven regenerative hub. Mechanistically, this axis activates epithelial $β$-catenin/Myc signaling, suppressing apoptosis and restoring barrier integrity independent of immune cells. Our findings define a CPTC-Driven Mechano-Resonance Axis, where CPTCs serve as synchronized relay stations that convert local mechanical cues into systemic regenerative microenvironments."}

Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition."}

An important challenge in the field is scaling cellular resolution models to real-scale tumor simulations, which is critical for the development of digital twin models of diseases and requires the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) since every time step involves trillions of operations. We hereby present a scalable HPC solution for the molecular diffusion modeling using an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method (FVM) frameworks. The paper systematically evaluates a novel scalable Biological Finite Volume Method (BioFVM) library and presents an extensive performance analysis of the available solutions. Results shows that our HPC proposal reach almost 200x speedup and up to 36% reduction in memory usage over the current state-of-the-art solutions, paving the way to efficiently compute the next generation of biological problems."}

However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery."}

Recent preclinical and clinical studies showed that combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 and cancer vaccines improved treatment response. In this study, we developed a multiscale mathematical model of interactions among tumors, immune cells, and cytokines to investigate tumor evolutionary dynamics under different therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we established a computational framework based on approximate Bayesian computation to generate virtual tumor samples and capture inter-individual heterogeneity in treatment response. The results demonstrated that a multiple low-dose regimen significantly reduced advanced tumor burden compared to baseline treatment in anti-PD-L1 therapy. In contrast, the maximum dose therapy yielded superior tumor growth control in cancer vaccine therapy. Furthermore, cytotoxic T cells were identified as a consistent predictive biomarker both before and after treatment initiation. Notably, the cytotoxic T cells-to-regulatory T cells ratio specifically served as a robust pre-treatment predictive biomarker, offering potential clinical utility for patient stratification and therapy personalization."}

We argue these axioms are plausible for species: if one were to define species based purely on genealogical relationships, it would be reasonable to define them in such a way as to satisfy these axioms. The main axiom we introduce, which we call the identical ancestor point axiom, states that for any organism in any species, either the species contains at most finitely many descendants of that organism, or else the species contains at most finitely many non-descendants of that organism. We show that this (together with a convexity axiom) reduces the subjectivity of species, in a technical sense. We call connected sets satisfying these two axioms \"specieslike clusters.\" We consider the question of identifying a set of biologically plausible constraints that would guarantee every organism inhabits a maximal specieslike cluster subject to those constraints. We provide one such set consisting of two constraints and show that no proper subset thereof suffices."}

Gordillo"], "title": "Intermittent precipitation and spatial Allee effects drive irregular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "nlin.AO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems frequently organizes into spatially heterogeneous mosaics that regulate ecosystem functioning, productivity, and resilience. These patterns arise from local biological interactions, including facilitation among neighboring plants and competition for limiting resources. Classical theoretical approaches have attributed such organization to scale-dependent feedbacks, predicting regular spatial patterns and abrupt transitions to collapse. However, growing empirical and theoretical evidence reveal that environmental variability and demographic stochasticity can fundamentally reshape spatial organization, driving irregular clusters, dynamic mosaics, and gradual rather than catastrophic vegetation declines. In drylands, rainfall variability is a dominant source of environmental forcing: precipitation typically occurs in short, irregular pulses that transiently enhance survival and recruitment before competitive interactions again dominate. Near persistence thresholds, ecosystem dynamics are therefore governed not only by average climatic conditions but also by the timing and spatial coincidence of favorable events. Under these conditions, positive density dependence and local facilitation can critically determine whether vegetation patches persist, expand, or collapse. Here, we develop an individual-based model that integrates intermittent precipitation with local Allee effects to examine how stochastic rainfall shapes spatial organization and persistence. We show that the interaction between pulsed resource availability and density-dependent survival generates irregular cluster structures and strongly modulates extinction risk, with resilience emerging from local spatial covariance and neighborhood density rather than from total biomass alone. These results highlight the importance of individual-level, stochastic processes in determining ecosystem resilience."}
