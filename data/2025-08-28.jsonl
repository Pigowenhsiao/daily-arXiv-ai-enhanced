Most existing methods either rely solely on sequence\nembeddings or struggle to capture complex structural relationships, thus\nlimiting predictive performance. In this work, we present a novel framework\nthat integrates sequence-based representations from pre-trained protein\nlanguage models (ESM-2) with a set of topological features. Specifically, we\nextract contact map metrics reflecting residue-level connectivity, interface\ngeometry descriptors characterizing cross-chain interactions, distance map\nstatistics quantifying spatial organization, and persistent homology invariants\nthat systematically capture the emergence and persistence of multi-scale\ntopological structures - such as connected components, cycles, and cavities -\nwithin individual proteins and across the antibody-antigen interface. By\nleveraging a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these diverse modalities, our\nmodel effectively encodes both global and local structural organization,\nthereby substantially enhancing the prediction of binding free energy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms\nsequence-only and conventional structural models, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy in binding free energy prediction."}

Here, Modal Geometric Field (MGF)\nTheory couples real and abstract proteoform transitions through four axioms.\nAxioms one-three (invariant) dictate that only first-order transitions occur on\nthe discrete, volume invariant, non symplectic modal manifold. Axiom four\n(mutable) functorially projects the general relativity derived curvature of an\ninstantiated proteoform into this modal manifold, coupling what is real to what\nis abstract. Curvature, conserved per a discrete Noether theorem, actively\nshapes proteoform dynamics. Because curvature distribution renders activation\nenergy relative, curvature-derived barriers are mutable, in direct analogy to\ngeneral relativity. Entropy then emerges inevitably from curvature transport.\nThis unification of energy, entropy, and curvature yields hysteresis, path\ndependence, fractal self similarity, and trajectories that oscillate between\norder and chaos. As a scale invariant and universal framework, MGF Theory\nreveals how modal geometry governs proteoform dynamics."}

Yet there are also disadvantages -- such as the homogenization of the\ngroup -- which make it harder for individuals to stand-out. Here we address\nthis tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from\nevolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested\n''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In\nour scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display\nbut position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack.\nThis allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the\nindividual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited\nnumber of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore\nincorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too\nfar from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and\nare punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural\npopulation compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not\nonly how, but also why, natural systems synchronize."}

For example, measurements of signaling readouts in the presence\nand absence of mutations may reveal a rank ordering of responses across\nconditions but not the precise extents of mutation-induced differences.\nQualitative data are often ignored by mathematical modelers or are considered\nin an ad hoc manner, as in the study of Kocieniewski and Lipniacki (2013) [Phys\nBiol 10: 035006], which was focused on the roles of MEK isoforms in ERK\nactivation. In this earlier study, model parameter values were tuned manually\nto obtain consistency with a combination of qualitative and quantitative data.\nThis approach is not reproducible, nor does it provide insights into parametric\nor prediction uncertainties. Here, starting from the same data and the same\nordinary differential equation (ODE) model structure, we generate formalized\nstatements of qualitative observations, making these observations more\nreusable, and we improve the model parameterization procedure by applying a\nsystematic and automated approach enabled by the software package PyBioNetFit.\nWe also demonstrate uncertainty quantification (UQ), which was absent in the\noriginal study.

A tantalising\nprospect is the possibility of estimating the unobserved dynamics of ion\nchannels which is largely inaccessible to experiment, from membrane voltage\nrecordings. The main roadblock here is our lack of knowledge of the equations\ngoverning biological neurons which forces us to rely on surrogate models and\nparameter estimates biassed by model error. Error correction algorithms are\ntherefore needed to infer both observed and unobserved dynamics, and ultimately\nthe actual parameters of a biological neuron. Here we use a recurrent neural\nnetwork to correct the outputs of a surrogate Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. The\nreservoir-surrogate HH model hybrid was trained on the voltage oscillations of\na reference HH model and its driving current waveform. Out of the six\nreservoir-surrogate model architectures investigated, we identify one that most\naccurately recovers the reference membrane voltage and ion channel dynamics.\nThe reservoir was thus effective in correcting model error in an externally\ndriven nonlinear oscillator and in reconstructing the dynamics of both observed\nand unobserved state variables from the reference model mimicking an actual\nneuron."}
