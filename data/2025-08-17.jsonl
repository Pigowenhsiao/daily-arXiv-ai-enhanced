By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes.

Wet-lab validations across these\npipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the\nmolecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.\nThis demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for\nvarious targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and\nfree version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development\nscientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes."}

Speech anomalies often emerge early after\ninjury, enabling rapid triage.\n  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion\nlocation, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published\ntrajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific\nneurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP,\nspeech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and\nlabel dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and\ntargeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations\nbetween GFAP elevation and speech severity.\n  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman\nrho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies\npreceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury.\nClassifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice\nonly), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity\nin mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased\nthe modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35\npercent, independent of lesion site and onset time.\n  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech\nanomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice\ndiagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury.\nFindings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical\nstudies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings."}

It is a\nbiennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to\nbuild models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.\nPrevious editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;\nthe 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field\nfurther by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting\nfMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the\ndataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie\nstimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours\nof training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature\nfilms (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall\nStreet). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for\nin-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who\ncould best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out\nout-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team\nreports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed\n4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they\nreveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next."}

Toward this end,\nseveral connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been\nproposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small\nnumber of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories\nand a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the\nConnectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).\nThe model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural\nbrain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while\nmaintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate\nour model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers\nInitiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging\nrepresentations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce\nbiomarker number."}

We introduce EDAPT, a task- and\nmodel-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model\nadaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple\nusers, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as\nthe neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets\ncovering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over\nconventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining\npopulation-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised\ndomain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs\nefficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade\nhardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than\nits allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway\ntoward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment."}

We investigated physiological and subjective responses to\npersonal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening\nfacial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence\nthese responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design\nmanipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression\n(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart\nrate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were\nindividually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR\nresponses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the\napproach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged\nproximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing\nthan the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,\nreflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort\nratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that\ndifferent physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic\nresponses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV\nresponds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing\ncomprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual\nenvironments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions."}
