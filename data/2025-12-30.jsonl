Fischl are co-senior authors with equal contributions", "summary": "Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks."}

Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs."}

Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum."}

Each ReSU projects a recent window of its input history onto a canonical direction obtained via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of previously observed past-future input pairs, and then rectifies either its positive or negative component. By encoding canonical directions in synaptic weights and temporal filters, ReSUs implement a local, self-supervised algorithm for progressively constructing increasingly complex features.\n  To evaluate both computational power and biological fidelity, we trained a two-layer ReSU network in a self-supervised regime on translating natural scenes. First-layer units, each driven by a single pixel, developed temporal filters resembling those of Drosophila post-photoreceptor neurons (L1/L2 and L3), including their empirically observed adaptation to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second-layer units, which pooled spatially over the first layer, became direction-selective -- analogous to T4 motion-detecting cells -- with learned synaptic weight patterns approximating those derived from connectomic reconstructions.\n  Together, these results suggest that ReSUs offer (i) a principled framework for modeling sensory circuits and (ii) a biologically grounded, backpropagation-free paradigm for constructing deep self-supervised neural networks."}

Unfortunately, the studies based on these attempts often overlooked the serious issues that can arise when quantifying biodiversity effects at larger scales, specifically the fact that biodiversity effects measured across space and time can contain trivial effects that are unrelated to the role of biodiversity per se -- or even effects that are non-biological in nature due to being simple artefacts of how properties and entities are counted and quantified. Here we outline and describe three such pseudo-biodiversity effects: Population-level effects, Independence effects, and Arithmetic effects. Population-level effects are those related to temporal changes due to individual species population growth or development, and are thus independent of biodiversity. Independence and Arithmetic effects (which we explore here primarily in a spatial context) arise either as a simple consequence of the fact that not all species are present everywhere -- i.e., species turnover is inevitable at greater spatial scales (Independence effects); or they arise when the purported biodiversity effects measured are a simple byproduct of how mathematical functions behave (Arithmetic effects). Our study demonstrates the necessity of controlling for these trivial artefactual effects if one wishes to meaningfully measure how true biodiversity effects change across spatial and temporal scales."}

Related to arXiv:2512.17106", "summary": "Biological systems organize into hierarchies to manage complexity, yet the mechanisms governing hierarchical control remain incompletely understood. Using information theory and the Lambda phage lysis-lysogeny decision as a model system, we discover that hierarchical control operates through hierarchical preemption - higher layers collapse decision space rather than blocking lower-layer signals. Through mutual information (MI) analysis of 200 stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that the UV damage sensor (RecA) achieves 2.01x information advantage over environmental signals by preempting bistable outcomes into monostable attractors (98% lysogenic or 85% lytic). Conditional MI analysis reveals that the integrator signal (CII) carries lower information when RecA is absent (saturated, 0.06 bits) than when RecA is active (subsaturated, 0.38 bits). This saturation effect demonstrates that signals orchestrate compartment behaviors by removing decision space - achieving 85-98% outcome certainty while preserving 2-15% escape routes. These findings establish a quantitative framework for hierarchical information processing in cellular decision-making."}

Atypical SP has been reported across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), suggesting it may constitute an early cross-syndromic marker. Premature birth is a major risk factor for ND, with risk increasing as gestational age (GA) at birth decreases. However, how perinatal risk factors shape the development of SP remains poorly understood. We do not know if untimely birth itself, or exposure to iatrogenic pain during neonatal intensive care, cause neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we first assessed whether SP can be detected in the brains of premature neonates at 35 weeks corrected GA using a tactile oddballomission paradigm with EEG. We then examined the effects of the degree of prematurity and of the exposure to painful care procedures on neural indices of SP. Results demonstrate the presence of repetition suppression (RS) and a mismatch response (MMR) to deviant stimuli in the contralateral somatosensory cortex of premature neonates. The amplitude of these SP proxies was significantly affected by the number of painful procedures experienced since birth, independently of the effect of GA at birth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that greater neurodevelopmental risk would be associated with less mature SP, infants with higher exposure to pain exhibited more robust indices of SP. These findings suggest that increased ex utero experience, even painful, is associated with accelerated maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Longitudinal follow-up of participants at age 2 will explore how these early markers relate to developmental outcomes."}

To resolve these issues, we introduce LiveProteinBench, a contamination-free, multimodal benchmark of 12 tasks for evaluating LLM performance on protein property and function prediction. Its central innovation lies in a test set composed exclusively of proteins validated after the start of 2025, guaranteeing that the data is novel to all tested models. We benchmarked a suite of prominent general-purpose LLMs and specialized biological LLMs using both unimodal and multimodal input schemes. Our results show that: 1) General-purpose proprietary large models demonstrate superior zero-shot performance when encountering new protein data, outperforming their open-source and domain-specific counterparts by over 20\\% accuracy. 2) The effective use of multi-view structural information remains a significant challenge, as the inclusion of structural images often fails to provide a consistent benefit and can even degrade performance. This highlights the limitations of current models in effectively fusing information across different modalities. 3) Models' performance scales more directly with the computational cost during inference than with its parameter count, underscoring the critical role of Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities for protein-specific tasks.

This task helps unveil the inner workings of the error-correction mechanism responsible for the resynchronization after a perturbation to the period of the stimuli sequence. Yet, fundamental contradictions still exist among different works in the literature. One of such contradictions only emerges after comparing the two most-common period perturbation types: step changes and phase shifts. The stimulus sequence is exactly the same in both perturbation types up to and including the (unexpected) perturbed stimulus. Why then would the timing of the next response be different between perturbation types, as observed? The explanation lies in the buildup of different temporal contexts during the experiments that recalibrate the error-correction mechanism. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that responses to different perturbation types are dynamically incompatible when they occur in separate experiments. That is, they can't be represented by the same underlying dynamical system, thus explaining many contradictory results and the difficulty in reproducing both types of perturbations with a single mathematical model. On the other hand, if both perturbation types are presented at random during the same experiment then the responses are compatible with each other and can be construed as produced by a unique underlying mechanism. We conclude that a single underlying dynamical system can represent the response to all perturbation types, signs, and sizes, which is nevertheless recalibrated by temporal context. Our results offer a ground for performing better comparisons in paced finger tapping and extend the usable range of data beyond the perturbed stimulus and into the information-rich resynchronization phase."}

Our results revealed a consistent $λ_E(A)$ relationship, largely independent of lattice geometry (except for the smallest $A$). This $λ_E(A)$ relationship obeyed universal scaling laws within two broad ranges of $A$.

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components.

In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations.

Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts.

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction."}

However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.\n  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity."}

Pearce", "Ahmed Ibrahim"], "title": "QSAR-Guided Generative Framework for the Discovery of Synthetically Viable Odorants", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "cs.LG", "q-bio.BM", "q-bio.QM"], "comment": null, "summary": "The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \\textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ...."}
