Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical\ntechnique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting\nthem, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in\nbiological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability\nprediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide\nidentification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.\nCurrent approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes\nthat a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,\nthis assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view\nand limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the\nfirst comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific\nfragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion\nprobability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair\nof peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million\nhigh-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide\nassignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance\nusing simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models\nleveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous\nmethods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance\nacross benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the\npeptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring\nsophisticated machine learning approaches."}

Our model captures key aspects of the egg\nchamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding\nepithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that\nguide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM)\nforce which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces\nbetween the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations\nreveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from\nprevious forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell\noverlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse\ncell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces,\nand (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of\nchemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or\nwithout geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as\nat intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of\nmechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to\ndorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of\nsmall amplitude.

The mutual information rate, a core concept of information\ntheory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of\ninput and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in\ndynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate\nis the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output\ntrajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to\nlinear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains\nunclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for\nnon-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent\ntechnique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case\nstudies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we\nfocus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's\nstatistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately\nestimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive\nsystem with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations\nbetween the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as\nnonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the\nGaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and\nhighlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are\nnecessary."}

In the mean-field theory,\nsynaptic delays give rise to uniform oscillations across the population through\na subcritical Hopf bifurcation of the stationary uniform equilibrium. With\nlocal excitation and long-range inhibition the network undergoes a Turing\nbifurcation, resulting in a localized area of sustained activity, or stationary\nbump.

Instead, information is encoded\nand transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using\na model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly\nanneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed\nrelative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and\ntheory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by\ncompetition for productive binding partners.
