Nelson contributed to this work as advisors to Latent Labs", "summary": "Drug discovery has long sought computational systems capable of designing drug-like molecules directly: developable and non-immunogenic from the start. Here we introduce Latent-X2, a frontier generative model that achieves this goal through zero-shot design of antibodies with strong binding affinities, drug-like properties, and, for the first time for any de novo generated antibody, confirmed low immunogenicity in human donor panels. Latent-X2 is an all-atom model conditioned on target structure, epitope specification, and optional antibody framework, jointly generating sequences and structures while modelling the bound complex. Testing only 4 to 24 designs per target in each modality, we successfully generated VHH and scFv antibodies against 9 of 18 evaluated targets, achieving a 50% target-level success rate with picomolar to nanomolar binding affinities. Designed molecules exhibit developability profiles that match or exceed those of approved antibody therapeutics, including expression yield, aggregation propensity, polyreactivity, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability, without optimization, filtering, or selection. In the first immunogenicity assessment of any AI-generated antibody, representative de novo VHH binders targeting TNFL9 exhibit both potent target engagement and low immunogenicity across T-cell proliferation and cytokine release assays. The model generalizes beyond antibodies: against K-Ras, long considered undruggable, we generated macrocyclic peptide binders competitive with trillion-scale mRNA display screens. These properties emerge directly from the model, demonstrating the therapeutic viability of zero-shot molecular design, now available without AI infrastructure or coding expertise at https://platform.latentlabs.com."}

Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods."}

Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their \"contact rates\" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model. The latter is based on a frequency-based force of infection and the mortality rate that rapidly increases once the proportion of infected individuals exceeds some prescribed threshold, resulting in a strain on medical resources. Numerical tests illustrate the properties of our model and highlight the ways in which additional/non-rational behavioral patterns and behavioral switching increase the impact of infectious diseases. The paper aims to build a bridge between two distinct communities of epidemiological modelers and to promote the consideration of behavioral patterns in broader Mean Field Games literature."}

However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents."}

Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures."}

Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).\n  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.\n  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.\n  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab."}

Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders."}
